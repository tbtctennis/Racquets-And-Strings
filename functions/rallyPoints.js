/**
 * Rally (rally) match points.
 *
 * A rally is recorded once a SECOND party confirms the reported score — the other player, or an
 * admin. Winner +2 leaguePoints26, loser +1; neither ever loses points, unlike a challenge's ±3.
 * Both players also get matchesPlayed +1 and a win/loss.
 *
 * Runs server-side because leaguePoints26 is organizer-gated in firestore.rules — no client can
 * write it. The rules also forbid the reporter confirming their own report; that check, not this
 * file, is what stops a player minting points.
 *
 * The `applied` stamp is written in the same transaction as the payout and checked first.
 * `status === 'confirmed'` is NOT proof of payment — the same defect already bit the RR +5 bonus.
 *
 * Deployment is environment-gated. Follow docs/architecture/ENVIRONMENTS_AND_DEPLOYMENT.md;
 * do not use a bare Firebase deploy command from this checkout.
