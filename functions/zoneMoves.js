/**
 * Zone moves — NOTIFY ONLY. This function never touches a match doc.
 *
 * A member picks their zone by hand on the profile card (`preferences.preferred_zone`, written by
 * `updatePreferredZone` in src/features/profile/services/profileService.ts). Zone decides which
 * draw they belong to, but a change must never unseat them:
 *
 *   1. Already playing, and the zone they moved TO has matches generated — they keep every match
 *      they're in, surface in the organizer's Unplaced Players list for the new zone (that list is
 *      zone-aware, see `unplacedParticipants` in useTournament.ts), and the organizer is told here.
 *      Nobody is auto-seated.
 *   2. The zone they moved to has NO matches yet — silent. Nothing to place them into and nothing
 *      to tell anyone; `preferred_zone` alone routes them in when that draw is generated, while
 *      they carry on in the draw they're already playing.
 *   3. Not in a tournament, or in one with no draw generated — silent, for the same reason.
 *
 * So this trigger's only job is the notification in case 1. Removing the player was the wrong
 * model and is deliberately absent: a player is never pulled out of matches that already exist.
 *
 * Deployment is environment-gated. Follow docs/architecture/ENVIRONMENTS_AND_DEPLOYMENT.md;
 * do not use a bare Firebase deploy command from this checkout.
