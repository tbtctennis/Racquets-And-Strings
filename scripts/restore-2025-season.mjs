/**
 * Restores 2025-season records for returning players.
 *
 * 2025 league points go into `leaguePoints25` (the live leaderboard reads `leaguePoints26`, left
 * untouched); 2025 match counters are added to the lifetime totals, which aren't season-scoped.
 *
 * Idempotent: anyone who already has `leaguePoints25` is skipped, so a re-run can't double-count.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/restore-2025-season.mjs --project rands-staging --key serviceAccount.json
 *   node scripts/restore-2025-season.mjs --project rands-staging --key serviceAccount.json --apply
 *
 * Dry-run is the default. Production additionally requires the migration confirmation triple.
