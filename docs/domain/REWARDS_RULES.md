# Rewards rules

## Redeemable balance

**Rule:** A player's redeemable balance is earned league points plus earned RS task points minus
points already spent in `offers/{uid}`. Redeeming does not mutate the earning counters.

**Why:** Match history, leaderboards, and task progress remain meaningful after a coupon is issued.

**Important exception:** A balance is clamped to a non-negative integer before redemption.

**Ruled change (2026-08-31, not yet implemented):** "Earned league points" becomes a lifetime
counter (`leagueEarnedTotal`) rather than the current season column. At the year boundary the
season column halves and the lifetime counter does not, so the balance carries forward whole —
[VISION.md](../planning/VISION.md) §10.5 and §10.8. Until the split lands the two are the same
number and the rule above reads correctly; **after the first halving it does not**, so the split
has to land first.

**Code:** `functions/rewards.js`, `functions/lib/points.js`.

**Regression test:** `functions/test/domain.test.js`; callable validation coverage in
`functions/test/callable.test.js`.

## Coupon ownership and idempotency

**Rule:** Redemption, use, flagging, cancellation, and review are callable Function workflows.
Each state transition is transaction-backed; a deterministic per-user/per-offer lock sentinel
ensures that a player can have only one open coupon for an offer, even when two redemptions race.

**Why:** The browser is an untrusted caller and a double tap must not spend points twice.

**Important exception:** A stringer may act only on coupons for that provider; organizers have the
separate review path.

**Code:** `functions/rewards.js`, `functions/lib/redemptionLock.js`, `functions/lib/callable.ts`,
`firestore.rules`.

**Regression test:** Rules tests cover client write protections; callable integration against the
Functions emulator remains a future stabilization item.

## Coupon state transitions

**Rule:** `active` may become `used`, `flagged`, or `cancel_requested`. A `flagged` coupon may be
marked `used` by the provider/organizer or returned to `active` by an organizer. Only
`cancel_requested` may be approved into `cancelled` and refunded; declining either review state
returns it to `active`. `used` and `cancelled` are terminal for those workflows.

**Why:** A coupon that is under dispute or cancellation review must not be redeemed through an
alternate path, and a used coupon must never be reactivated and reused.

**Important exception:** Provider notes, cancellation reasons, and reviewer notes are optional but
are capped at 500 characters at the callable boundary.

**Code:** `functions/lib/redemptionState.js`, `functions/rewards.js`.

**Regression test:** `functions/test/redemptionState.test.js` and the bounded-string cases in
`functions/test/callable.test.js`.

## Contributor Badge

**Rule:** The Contributor Badge is derived from `payments/{paymentId}`. A cancelled donation is a
refunded donation: `state` is `refunded` and `stripe_refund_id` is set together. That row drops
out of the badge calculation. The badge follows the **refund**, not the cancellation request, so a
pending request changes nothing. A member keeps the badge while any donation of theirs is still
unrefunded. Court-booking rows never count.

**Why:** TASK-617 / D9-P4-T2. The badge must not drift from the money, and a request is not a refund.

**Important exception:** Stripe test mode only until M6. An approval that fails at Stripe leaves
the request pending and the badge intact.

**Code:** `src/features/payments/refundMeaning.ts`, `functions/lib/refundMeaning.js`.

**Regression test:** `tests/unit/refundMeaning.test.mjs`, `functions/test/payments.test.js`.
