## Detail

**After.** Sensitive writes enforce types, bounds, immutable fields.

**Acceptance.** Sensitive writes enforce types, bounds, immutable fields.

**Planning source.** `docs/planning/history/BACKLOG-BLG.md` — behaviour lives there. This file tracks status only. No code in this tracker.

## Execute

When **execute sprint spiderman** reaches this item:

1. Set **Status** to `inprogress`. Add a Comments row (date, who, started).
2. Read **Read first**, then the current code those files name. If docs and code disagree, record it in Comments and follow the ruling / current code deliberately.
3. Implement only this item. Do not widen scope.
4. Prove it with the smallest tests that cover the acceptance line, then `npm run verify` before `completed`.
5. **If something fails that this item did not already describe:** open the next free `BUG-n`, set Related task to this id, comment both files, add the bug to `bug/README.md` and the tracker. Leave this item `blocked` if it cannot continue.
6. On success: **Status** `completed`, Comments row, update `docs/development/sprint/tracking/SPIDERMAN-TRACKER.md`.
7. Do not deploy staging or production.
