# Sprint D6 — corrections and the partner pool

> **Status: in progress.** Wave 1 is implemented on `spiderman` and not green-closed (BUG-507, BUG-508). This file is behaviour source, not completion evidence. Live status: [Spiderman tracker](../../../development/sprint/tracking/SPIDERMAN-TRACKER.md). Closure: [D6-CLOSURE-REPORT.md](D6-CLOSURE-REPORT.md).

> **Fix what the first five sprints got wrong or left out, then build what was missed.**
> Everything here is small and specific. The component work is [Sprint D7](SPRINT-D7.md).

### Added 2026-08-29

| #       | Item                                            | Lane    | Why it is here and not later                                                                                                                                       |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **C12** | `services` security rules                       | A1      | **C8 cannot be verified without it.** `firestore.rules` has no `services` block at all, so the catalogue falls through to deny and no Book button can be confirmed |
| **C13** | Score margin threshold 10 → 21                  | A1 + A3 | Three layers must change together                                                                                                                                  |
| **C14** | No re-notification on a lower-margin accept     | A1      | Same code path as C13; do them together                                                                                                                            |
| **C15** | **One result model** for challenges and rallies | A1 + A3 | [Ruling 1](../../decisions/DECISIONS-2026-08-29.md). Three ways to record the same thing; entering a rally score stays optional                                                 |
| **C16** | Re-seat a re-added participant                  | A1 + A3 | The placer never fires for them; blocks the withdrawal round-trip C4 and L12 assume                                                                                |
| **C17** | Four event types                                | A2 + A3 | [Ruling 5](../../decisions/DECISIONS-2026-08-29.md). Live data holds five, including `tournament` in lower case                                                                 |
| **C18** | Remove per-event draw hiding                    | A3      | [Ruling 4](../../decisions/DECISIONS-2026-08-29.md). `hide_seniors` / `hide_beginners` go; the Retired Pro draw stays                                                           |
| **C19** | Zone change without approval                    | A1 + A3 | [Ruling 7](../../decisions/DECISIONS-2026-08-29.md). Organizer is notified, not asked                                                                                           |

### Added 2026-08-31

From [VISION.md](../../VISION.md) and the [2026-08-31 rulings](../../specs/2026-08-31-vision-gaps-design.md). These had no sprint id; they belong here because they are corrections to stored data and server behaviour, the same class as C1–C19.

| #       | Item                            | Lane         | Phase | Why it is here                                                                                                                           |
| ------- | ------------------------------- | ------------ | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **C20** | The `location` field            | A1 + A2 + A3 | M1    | [VISION §2](../../VISION.md). Every location rule depends on it, and adding it after beta means a live-data migration. **Wide refactor**    |
| **C21** | `friendly` → `rally`            | A1 + A2 + A3 | M1    | [VISION §8](../../VISION.md). One term, in code, UI and stored data. Same code path as C15 — do them together. **Wide refactor**            |
| **C22** | League points halve at year end | A1           | M1    | [Ruling 5, 2026-08-31](../../specs/2026-08-31-vision-gaps-design.md). Ranking only; the spendable balance carries forward untouched         |
| **C23** | Beta notifications stay in-app  | A1           | M1    | [Ruling 3, 2026-08-31](../../specs/2026-08-31-vision-gaps-design.md). Nothing leaves the app during the beta; this constrains existing code |

**C20 and C21 are wide refactors.** Neither can land as one change — they are sequenced expand → migrate in batches → contract, so the suite stays green between batches. The planner breaks them down that way; see [tasks/README.md](../../tasks/README.md).

## A5 · Verify — do this first

### ⬛ V1 — Confirm the suite passes on `ac4dfb1`

`npm run verify` runs on every push. Commits `411ffed`, `5cdacee` and `54cea44` show a failed check and nothing records it being fixed. **Establish whether the branch is green before anyone adds to it.** If it is red, report what fails; that becomes task zero.

### ⬛ V2 — A test for every correction

Each must fail on today's code. Priority: **C1** (no test covers the case at all, which is why the bug shipped), then C2, C3, C5.

---

## Corrections

### ⬛ C1 — The knockout gate · A3

**Files** · `src/pages/tournament/useTournament.ts:1301-1307` · `src/pages/tournament/RoundRobinView.tsx:232-241`

**Now**

```ts
const rrKnockoutReady = useMemo(
  () =>
    rrGroupMatches.length > 0 &&
    rrGroupMatches.every((m) => m.status === 'complete' && m.player_1_uid && m.player_2_uid) &&
    rrKnockoutMatches.length === 0,
  [rrGroupMatches, rrKnockoutMatches],
);
```

Two faults. The `every` demands all group matches be complete, which decision 4 removes. And the placeholder guard was ANDed into the predicate instead of filtering the set, so an empty placeholder match returns `false` and the gate stays shut forever — the bug [D1](../d1-d5/SPRINT-D1.md) was meant to close.

**Build**

```ts
// Real matches only. A group left with one player keeps an empty placeholder match
// that can never be played, so it must not count toward readiness or the warning.
const rrRealGroupMatches = useMemo(
  () => rrGroupMatches.filter((m) => m.player_1_uid && m.player_2_uid),
  [rrGroupMatches],
);

const rrGroupUnplayed = useMemo(
  () => rrRealGroupMatches.filter((m) => m.status !== 'complete').length,
  [rrRealGroupMatches],
);

// The organizer may build the knockout whenever they like. Unplayed group matches
// are a warning, not a block, because the group stage runs the whole season.
const rrKnockoutReady = useMemo(
  () => rrRealGroupMatches.length > 0 && rrKnockoutMatches.length === 0,
  [rrRealGroupMatches, rrKnockoutMatches],
);
```

Export `rrGroupUnplayed`, pass it through `Tournament.tsx` to `RoundRobinView`, and show it above the size bar:

> _"{n} group matches still to play. You can build the knockout now and group results will keep counting."_

Update the guard in `handleGenerateRRKnockout` at `src/pages/tournament/useTournament.ts:2355` to test `rrRealGroupMatches.length === 0`.

Group matches keep scoring normally after the knockout exists. No change to the result path.

**Done when** · a draw with a one-player group can open the knockout · a draw with unplayed matches can too and shows the count · a draw with no real group matches still cannot · a test covers the one-player group and fails on today's code.

---

### ⬛ C2 — Restore points won and total points played · A1

**File** · `functions/lib/tournamentResult.js:131-150`

The writer was removed but every reader is still live, so **every member's percentage is frozen and new members read a dash forever**. Restore both, to the **played** branch only.

```js
const winnerIsP1 = result.winnerUid === match.player_1_uid;
const loserUid = winnerIsP1 ? match.player_2_uid : match.player_1_uid;
const p1Games = result.scores.reduce((sum, pair) => sum + pair[0], 0);
const p2Games = result.scores.reduce((sum, pair) => sum + pair[1], 0);
const total = p1Games + p2Games;
const award = tournamentAward(match);
for (const uid of creditedUids(result.winnerUid)) {
  addDelta(deltas, uid, {
    matchesPlayed: 1,
    wins: 1,
    ...(award.winnerPointsApply ? { leaguePoints26: award.winnerPoints } : {}),
    league,
    pointswon: winnerIsP1 ? p1Games : p2Games,
    totalPointsPlayed: total,
  });
}
for (const uid of creditedUids(loserUid)) {
  addDelta(deltas, uid, {
    matchesPlayed: 1,
    leaguePoints26: award.loserPoints,
    league,
    pointswon: winnerIsP1 ? p2Games : p1Games,
    totalPointsPlayed: total,
  });
}
```

**Not in the walkover branch.** A walkover has no games, and it already writes no `matchesPlayed` or `wins`. Keep it consistent.

**Not in friendlies or ladder challenges.** They have never counted toward this figure — it is tournament games only. Leave `friendlyPoints.js` and `competitionResults.js` alone.

Reversal is automatic. `mergeStatDeltas(…, -1)` inverts whatever the delta holds, so a rescore stays exact.

**Done when** · a scored match moves both figures for both players · a rescore leaves them equal to a fresh recompute · a walkover moves neither · a test pins all three.

---

### ⬛ C3 — `tournamentsPlayed` counts events joined · A1 + A2

**Files** · `functions/lib/tournamentResult.js:139,148` · `functions/participantWorkflow.js:91`

Today the loser branch adds `tournamentsPlayed: 1` on **every loss**, and the winner only on the final. The original reasoning was that losing a knockout put you out, so the tournament was done. That is redundant now the group stage runs the season.

**Build**

1. Remove `tournamentsPlayed` from both branches of `statDeltasForResult`.
2. In `onParticipantCreated`, when the new participant is for a **tournament** event, increment `stats/{uid}.tournamentsPlayed` by 1.
3. Leave it alone on withdrawal. They did join.

**A2 backfill.** Existing values equal each member's loss count. Recompute as the number of distinct tournament events each member has a participant row for. Dry-run first against the seeded emulator, which carries real production shape and volume. Nothing live is touched, so the diff is safe to apply once read.

**Done when** · joining a tournament increments it once · scoring a match never moves it · the backfill diff is read and approved.

---

### ⬛ C4 — Delete `loses` · A1 + A3 + A2

**Verified: it is displayed on no screen.** It reaches the leaderboard row object and an opponent-panel props type, and neither renders it. The Round Robin group table does show a loss column, but that counts the group's own matches and never touches `stats.loses`.

### ⬛ C5 — One award table · A1

**File** · `functions/withdrawalWorkflow.js:10,72,112`

```js
const AWARDS = { R32: 1, R16: 2, QF: 3, SF: 5, F: 10 };   // third copy
const withdrawalAward = (round) => AWARDS[round] || 1;
...
const points = rr ? 1 : withdrawalAward(current.round);
```

**Build** — import the shared one. Same package, already exported:

```js
const { tournamentAward } = require('./lib/tournamentResult');
...
const award = tournamentAward({ round: current.round, format: current.format });
const points = award.loserPoints;              // RR is already 1 in the shared table
const opponentPoints = rr ? 1 : 0;
```

Delete `AWARDS`, `withdrawalAward` and the export at `:112`. Check for test consumers first.

Three copies become two. The last two cross the server/browser boundary and cannot share a file; **[Sprint D7](SPRINT-D7.md) group 6 removes the need for the browser copy.**

**The payout is unchanged by [ruling 15](../../decisions/DECISIONS-2026-08-29.md):** a withdrawing player takes **the round's points in a knockout** (R32 1 · R16 2 · QF 3 · SF 5 · F 10) and **1 point per unplayed match in a Round Robin**. The shared `tournamentAward` already returns exactly that, which is why importing it is safe.

> **The three tables agree by accident, not by construction.** `scoring.ts:38` and `tournamentResult.js:92` both carry `RR: 1`; the third omits `RR` entirely and falls through to `|| 1`. It has always matched by coincidence — which is the argument for collapsing it.

**Withdrawal points must not count as matches played** (ruling 15). That already holds: the withdrawal writes match documents directly (`:55-70`) rather than going through the result callable, so `matchesPlayed` and `wins` are never touched. **Pin it with a test** — routing this through the result path later would silently start counting them.

**Done when** · withdrawal payouts are unchanged · a withdrawing player's `matchesPlayed` and `wins` stay put, with a test · `grep -c "R32: 1" functions/` returns 1.

### ⬛ C9 — No-show leftovers · A1

### ⬛ C10 — Retire `result_application` · A1

[L3](../../history/planning-2026-08-23/notes/HARMONIZATION_REPORT.md#L3) said the idempotency hash moves inside `result_submissions`. Both exist today.

**File** · `functions/tournamentResults.js:212, 223, 307`

The duplicate check requires both:

```js
if (existingSubmission?.hash === hash && match.result_application?.hash === hash) { … }
```

Move the applied hash into `result_submissions` by marking the applied submission with `applied: true`, and test against that. The `!!target.data.result_application` check at `:223` becomes a check for any applied submission.

**Lowest priority of the corrections.** If the sprint runs long, defer it. This is tidiness, not behaviour.

---

### ⬛ C11 — Mistyped addresses go home · A3

**File** · `src/App.tsx:42, :173`

Replace the catch-all with `<Route path="*" element={<Navigate to="/" replace />} />`, delete the lazy import at `:42`, delete `src/pages/NotFound.tsx`. **Keep `replace`** so Back does not re-enter the redirect.

---

### ⬛ C12 — `services` security rules · A1

**File** · `firestore.rules` — insert at **:303**, between the `providers` block (299-302) and `bookings` (304-314).

```
// The catalogue is public so a logged-out visitor can browse what is on offer. Writes are
// owner-gated through a callable; booking is members-only because every booking transition
// goes through Functions, which require auth.
match /services/{serviceId} {
  allow read: if true;
  allow write: if false;
}
```

Nothing else is needed for "members can book, visitors cannot": `bookings` is already `allow write: if false` (:313) with reads scoped to owner, super-admin or linked provider (:306-312).

**Deferred — provider contact.** Booking will create a connection keyed on `services.provider_id` → `providers/{providerId}`, and the contact button plus booking number appear once the member books or the provider accepts. Same shape as the opponent `connections/{a__b}` mechanism. **Not this sprint.** While it is deferred, note that `contact_phone` and `contact_email` sit on the world-readable service document, so they are readable by anyone querying the collection directly.

**Done when** · an anonymous read of `services` succeeds · an authenticated write is denied · a super-admin write is denied · C8's Book button can be confirmed.

### ⬛ C13 — Score margin threshold 10 → 21 · A1 + A3

Any score above **21** must have a margin of exactly 2. Below or at 21, no margin rule.

| File                                                | Line  | Change                      |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----- | --------------------------- |
| `firestore.rules`                                   | 161   | `high <= 10` → `high <= 21` |
| `functions/lib/tournamentResult.js`                 | 44-45 | condition and message text  |
| `src/features/tournament/domain/scoreSubmission.ts` | 26-27 | same                        |

**All three in one commit.** This project has a documented incident where two copies of a scoring rule drifted apart and players were shown points nobody had paid.

**One contract example flips.** Of the twelve in the harmonization report, `12-2` moves from **invalid to valid** — 12 is under the threshold, so no margin applies. `40-0` and `90-40` stay invalid; `24-22`, `38-40` and `94-92` stay valid.

> **Finding F-E is stale.** It records that the margin rule "exists in no layer" and that Rules cap scores at 0-7. Both were fixed since: `firestore.rules:156` allows 0-99 and `:159` implements the margin. All three layers already agree — this change moves one number in each.

**Done when** · `21-19` valid · `22-19` rejected · `12-2` accepted · one test per layer.

---

### ⬛ C14 — No re-notification when a lower score is accepted · A1

**File** · `functions/tournamentResults.js` — the `result.margin < oldResult.margin` path falling out of the guard at **:266** into the apply block.

Today a same-winner reconcile re-applies and notifies both players again. The result did not change hands and the players already know the outcome, so the second notification is noise. Thread a flag through the apply path so a reconcile applies silently.

The neighbouring branch at `:266-268` (margin greater or equal) already returns `notices: []` — match it.

> Per finding **F-M**, once `loses` is derived and games stop being stored, a same-winner reconcile has **no stat consequences at all** — every surviving delta depends on winner, round and format. So this path is a pure score-field update, which is exactly why it should not notify.

**Done when** · a lower-margin resubmission updates the score and sends nothing · a winner change still notifies · a dispute still notifies the organizer once.

---

### ⬛ C15 — One result model for challenges and rallies · A1 + A3

**Ruling [1](../../decisions/DECISIONS-2026-08-29.md).** Challenges and rallies each ran their own five-state handshake, with different words for identical states, and neither matched how a tournament result is entered. Three ways to record the same thing.

> **A rally without a score is not a failure.** Entering one is optional by design — a way to earn extra points — and choosing not to is a normal outcome. This change is about how a score behaves _when_ it is entered.

**Files** · `functions/competitionResults.js` · `functions/notifications.js:262-366` · `src/pages/tournament/useTournament.ts`

**Build** — challenges and rallies adopt the tournament result model exactly:

| Rule                                            | Change                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Either player submits                           | The result callable opens to both players, as it already did for tournaments                                                    |
| **Applies immediately**                         | Delete the `accepted → reported → confirmed` handshake. No organizer confirmation on challenges                                 |
| Two submissions, same winner, lower margin wins | Shared with the tournament path                                                                                                 |
| Two submissions, different winners              | `score_disputed` flag; first result stays applied; organizer resolves                                                           |
| **A rally score is optional**                   | A rally is a way to earn extra points. If neither player submits, nothing is recorded, no points are paid, and nobody is chased |
| Walkovers                                       | Tournaments only, organizer-only, stored                                                                                        |

**Retires** the rally `disputed` dead end (finding **F-K** — nothing transitioned out of it).

**Notifications.** A declined challenge notifies **the player who created it**. Decline and reject are one event; `declined` is the surviving word ([ruling 2](../../decisions/DECISIONS-2026-08-29.md)).

> `ladder_cancelled` (`notifications.js:358`) stays what it is — the _challenger_ withdrawing their own open challenge, notifying the person challenged. A decline is the opposite direction and needs its own notification.

**Done when** · either player can submit on a challenge and a rally · the score applies with no confirmation step · a second submission with a different winner flags a dispute · an unsubmitted rally pays nothing and is never chased · declining notifies the creator · `grep -rn "'rejected'" src/ functions/` returns nothing.

### ⬛ C16 — Re-seat a re-added participant · A1 + A3

**Files** · `functions/participantWorkflow.js:91` (`onParticipantCreated`) · `:66` (`seatParticipant`) · `:73` (`choosePlacement`)

A player who withdraws and is re-added is **never placed**, for two independent reasons:

1. **No trigger fires.** The placer is `onDocumentCreated`. Re-adding flips `status` back to `active`, which is an _update_, so `seatParticipant` never runs.
2. **No slot exists.** `choosePlacement` looks for an open `PLAYER_LOADING` slot. After generation there are none, so it returns `null`.

**Owner ruling 2026-08-31, refining option B.** Placement follows the event type. A tournament labelled **Round Robin** gives them group matches, counting for group points only. A tournament labelled **knockout** puts them back in the draw. Either way, an existing bracket is never rebuilt around them and nobody already playing is moved.

**Timing decides how.** Re-added **before** matches are generated, they take an open slot. Re-added **after** generation, they go to the **unplaced players list** and the organizer assigns the slot.

**Build**

1. Add an `onDocumentUpdated` path on `event_participants` firing when `status` goes `withdrawn → active`.
2. Extend `choosePlacement` so it can **create** group matches for the re-added player rather than only fill an empty slot.
3. Never touch knockout matches. If the knockout for that draw already exists, the player joins the group stage only.

**Done when** · a withdrawn player re-added before generation takes an open slot in either format · re-added after generation appears in the unplaced players list for the organizer to assign · an existing bracket is unchanged and nobody already playing is moved · a test covers the re-add round trip in both formats.

### ⬛ C17 — Four event types · A2 + A3

**Ruling [5](../../decisions/DECISIONS-2026-08-29.md).** `Socials` · `Tournaments` · `Specials` · `League Ladder`. Nothing else.

Live data holds **five values across ten events**, including **`tournament` in lower case** beside `Tournament`. That is a data defect, so this needs a migration as well as a validator.

**Build** · constrain the type on the event-creation modal · **A2 migration** normalising the one lower-case row · reject anything outside the four on write.

**Done when** · the modal offers exactly four types · no event carries a value outside them · the casing split is gone. Closes [BLG0019](../../history/BACKLOG-BLG.md).

### ⬛ C18 — Remove per-event draw hiding · A3

**Ruling [4](../../decisions/DECISIONS-2026-08-29.md).** Delete `hide_seniors` and `hide_beginners`.

**Files** · `src/pages/tournament/useTournament.ts:216-217` (the two filter lines) and `:256-257` (the deps) · `src/lib/firestoreNormalization.ts:108-109` · `src/types.ts`

**The Retired Pro draw itself survives.** It is a separate, league-gated concept (`useJoin.ts:140-142`), not the toggle. Same for Beginners.

**A draw already appears only when players in that category join** — seniors, beginners and every zone draw follow who actually signed up, so an empty category shows nothing on its own. The toggles duplicated what participation already handles.

**Done when** · both draws always render · `grep -rn "hide_seniors|hide_beginners" src/` returns nothing · a migration strips the fields.

---

### ⬛ C19 — Zone change without approval · A1 + A3

**Ruling [7](../../decisions/DECISIONS-2026-08-29.md).** A member selects zones freely. **The organizer is notified, not asked.**

Folds into [F2](#f2). The tournament page "Request Zone Change" control (`TournamentElements.tsx:91`) becomes a direct change, matching the profile card. One path, not two.

**The control reads `Change Your Zone`**, not "Request Zone Change". Nothing is being requested.

**Done when** · the button reads `Change Your Zone` · changing zone needs no approval anywhere · the organizer receives a notification · no approval UI remains.

---

### ⬛ C20 — The `location` field · A1 + A2 + A3 · wide refactor

**Ruling** · [VISION §2](../../VISION.md). A **location** is a city's competition community, created by an event's location. Everything existing becomes `Toronto`. A member's location is derived from the city of their preferred courts, set at signup with no extra UI, and updates when they change courts. Playing is location-scoped — a challenge or rally to another location is refused **server-side**; across zones inside a location it is allowed. Only the global leaderboard is visible across locations.

> **`location`, never `league`.** `league` is the app's existing Men's/Women's field (`src/features/profile/services/profileService.ts`, the ladder, event divisions). The two must not collide.

**Sequence** · expand: add `location` beside what exists and derive it from the member preferred courts · migrate: rules, functions, then client read paths in batches · contract: enforce location scoping and remove any interim fallback.

> **`Toronto` is written only when a member preferred courts include a Toronto court** (owner ruling 2026-08-31). It is never a blanket default. A member with no courts, or courts that map to no city, is left **unset**. An unset location must not stop them playing: they can send and receive challenges and rallies **within the location of any event they have joined** (owner ruling 2026-08-31), so joining an event is what admits them to a location rather than their courts.

**Done when** · a member whose courts include a Toronto court carries `Toronto` and one with no mapped court is left unset · a cross-location challenge and a cross-location rally are both refused by rules and by the callable · a cross-zone challenge inside Toronto still succeeds · a member with no location can still send and receive challenges and rallies within the location of an event they have joined, and nowhere else · the leaderboard still shows every location · a test covers each of those.

---

### ⬛ C21 — `friendly` → `rally` · A1 + A2 + A3 · wide refactor

**Ruling** · [VISION §8](../../VISION.md). **`rally` is the canonical term.** `friendly` and `friendlies` disappear from code, UI and stored data. Entering a rally score stays optional; an unplayed rally pays nothing.

Today the term is load-bearing in `src/features/friendlies/rallyService.ts`, its callers, tests, and stored documents. C15 rewrites the same result path — **do C21 and C15 together** rather than renaming twice.

**Sequence** · expand: add the `rally` form beside `friendly` · migrate: call sites in batches, then stored data · contract: delete `friendly`.

**Done when** · `grep -rni "friendl" src/ functions/ tests/` returns nothing outside archived planning documents · no stored document carries the old term · the rally result path is C15's single result model.

---

### ⬛ C22 — League points halve at the year boundary · A1 · DEFERRED

**Ruling** · [ruling 5, 2026-08-31](../../specs/2026-08-31-vision-gaps-design.md). At the end of the year that season's league points **halve** — 100 becomes 50. The halving applies to **ranking only**; the member's spendable balance carries forward untouched.

> **Deferred out of D6 by the owner, 2026-08-31.** League points are also half the wallet today: `functions/rewards.js:4` computes a member redeemable balance as `leaguePoints26` plus earned task points minus points already spent. Halving them now would halve unspent purchasing power, which the ruling forbids. The **wallet split** is itself deferred to an end of year milestone, and the split must land **before** the first halving ever runs. Both pieces are therefore end of year work, in that order.

**Done when, whenever it is built** · a season rollover halves league points for ranking and leaves the spendable balance unchanged · the two figures are separate in the data · the halving is idempotent, so running it twice does not halve twice · a test covers a member holding both.

---

### ⬛ C23 — Beta notifications stay in the app · A1

**Ruling** · [ruling 3, 2026-08-31](../../specs/2026-08-31-vision-gaps-design.md). **In-app only for the September beta.** Nothing is sent outside the app.

This constrains existing code rather than adding any: server-side email paths must not fire for beta traffic, and the in-app notification record stays the only delivery.

**Done when** · no beta-triggered path sends email · in-app notifications still record and display · a test asserts the outbound path is not called.

## Features

### ⬛ F1 — The doubles partner pool · all lanes

**The join sheet already promises this.** `EventsElements.tsx:679` reads _"No partner yet? Leave this blank to join the event's partner pool."_ and no pool exists. A member who leaves that field blank today joins nothing.

#### A2 — Schema

Two subcollections under the event, so a security rule can check membership with one lookup.

```jsonc
// partner_pool/{eventId}/members/{uid}       ← the list, any signed-in member may read
{
  "uid": "…",
  "name": "Rahul Lal",
  "category": "mens",        // 'mens' | 'womens' | 'mixed'
  "skill": 3.5,
  "created_at": "2026-08-25T…"
}

// partner_pool/{eventId}/contacts/{uid}      ← pool members only, written by the server
{
  "whatsapp": "…",
  "phone": "…",
  "email": "…"
}
```

The document id is the uid, so rejoining is a no-op rather than a duplicate. `category` mirrors the division the member registered in, so a men's-doubles player never sees the women's pool.

#### A1 — Rules

```
match /partner_pool/{eventId}/members/{uid} {
  allow read: if isAuthenticated();
  allow create: if isAuthenticated() && uid == request.auth.uid &&
    request.resource.data.keys().hasOnly(['uid','name','category','skill','created_at']);
  allow update: if false;
  allow delete: if isAuthenticated() && (uid == request.auth.uid || isManagerOfEvent(eventId));
}

match /partner_pool/{eventId}/contacts/{uid} {
  allow read: if isAuthenticated() &&
    exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/partner_pool/$(eventId)/members/$(request.auth.uid));
  allow write: if false;   // server only
}
```

> **Rules do not cascade into subcollections.** Each path needs its own `match` block at the full nested path. This is the exact trap that silently broke Round Robin drafts for months — the rule existed at the wrong level, every write was denied, and the error path swallowed it. **Verify a write actually lands before moving on.**

#### A1 — Triggers

**`onPartnerPoolJoin`** — on create of `partner_pool/{eventId}/members/{uid}`:

1. Write `partner_pool/{eventId}/contacts/{uid}` from the member's `contacts` document, carrying only the channels they have filled in.
2. Notify every **other** member in the same event **and** the same `category`:

> **"A new player is waiting to partner up!"** — _{name} joined the {category} doubles pool for {event}._

Link to the pool panel. Do not notify the joiner.

**`onPartnerPoolLeave`** — on delete: delete the matching contacts document. **Access ends with membership.**

#### A3 — Client

- `src/features/events/services/partnerPool.ts` — `joinPool`, `leavePool`, `usePool(eventId, category)` live subscription, `usePoolContacts(eventId)` which only resolves for members.
- Join sheet: leaving the partner field blank **joins the pool** on submit. Make the existing hint true.
- Choosing a partner from the pool **removes both rows**, in the same batch as `setDoublesPartner`.
- A member may leave the pool without choosing anyone.

#### A4 — UI

Three states on the doubles tournament tab:

| The member is…                            | What they see                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **In the pool**                           | The pool panel is **open by default**, listing every member with name, skill and full contact buttons. A **Partner pool** button re-opens it if they close it by mistake |
| **Paired**                                | They see the draw. A **Partner pool** button opens the list — names and skill only, **no contact buttons**                                                               |
| **In the doubles event, not in the pool** | Same as paired: the list, no contacts                                                                                                                                    |

Contacts come from the `contacts` subcollection, which only resolves for members. Reuse `contactChannels` from `ContactOpponentButton` — do not build a second contact control. A denied read is expected for non-members and must not surface as an error.

Empty state: _"Nobody is waiting yet. Join the pool and other players looking for a partner will see you."_

#### A5 — Tests

Joining creates one row · rejoining is a no-op · every other member of the same category is notified and the joiner is not · a men's player never sees the women's pool · **a non-member reading the contacts subcollection is denied** · choosing a partner removes both rows and both contact documents · leaving removes the contact document.

### ⬛ F2 — Courts, not zones, at join · A3 + A4

**Files** · `src/features/events/hooks/useJoin.ts:112, 132-133` · `src/features/events/EventsElements.tsx:612-627` · `src/pages/tournament/TournamentElements.tsx:91` · `src/features/profile/components/ProfileInfo.tsx:266`

**Now** the join sheet shows a row of **zone** chips and blocks on a missing zone. The member picks a zone directly.

**Build**

1. **Replace the zone chips with a court multi-select.** Several courts, matching the profile shape. Derive the zone through the existing `resolveZone` and set `preferred_zone_manual` on an explicit pick.
2. **Add a link below the picker** to `/courts` (`App.tsx:167`), opening the map **with all courts and the zone layers visible**, so a member can see which zone a court sits in before choosing.
3. **Keep the gate**, but test courts rather than zone: the join is blocked until at least one court is chosen.
4. **Tournament tab:** `TournamentElements.tsx:91` reads _"Request Zone Change"_ and raises a request an organizer must approve. **Make it a direct change.** No request, no approval. Keep writing `req_zone_change` so the organizer still sees the notice, but drop the approval step.
5. **Profile card:** the zone sheet at `ProfileInfo.tsx:266` already changes zone directly. Add the same `/courts` link beneath it.
6. **A zone change still places the member in both draws.** `onZoneChanged` is unchanged. The organizer is informed, not asked.
7. **A custom court name is accepted.** The member's zone resolves to **none**. Then:
   - Notify **the event organizer and the super-admin**: review the court and add it to the courts list.
   - The member appears in **Unplaced** with **"No zone"**.
   - **The placer never guesses a zone for them.** They wait there until the organizer assigns a zone and adds them to a draw.

**Done when** · a member with no courts cannot join until they pick at least one · the zone is derived, never typed · the courts link opens the map with zone layers on · changing zone needs no approval and never unseats anyone · an unmapped court raises a notice and lands the member in Unplaced with no zone.

### ⬛ F3 — Knockout size moves both ways, in edit mode · A3 + A4

**File** · `src/pages/tournament/useTournament.ts:2354-2385` · `src/pages/tournament/RoundRobinView.tsx:52-70`

**Now** the guard is expand-only:

```js
if (existingSize > 0 && (!size || size <= existingSize)) {
  setMessage({ type: 'error', text: `Knockout can only expand beyond ${existingSize} slots.` });
  return;
}
```

Decision 8 replaces that rule.

| Growing   | Unchanged. Existing matches are kept; only new slots are written                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Shrinking | **Refuse if any slot being dropped holds a generated or played match.** The message names them: _"Cannot reduce to {n}: {x} matches already exist in the slots that would be removed."_ Otherwise delete the empty slot documents |
| Always    | **A recorded score is never deleted.** That rule has not changed                                                                                                                                                                  |

**Done when** · 8→16 keeps every existing match · 16→8 with an empty upper half succeeds · 16→8 with a played match in the upper half is refused, naming it · the bar is inert outside edit mode · 4 cannot be reduced further.
