# Sprint D8 — seeding, the coaching pool, and the workflow record

> **Status: planned.** Behaviour source, not completion evidence.

> **Knockout seeding, the deferred service work, and the documents that were never written.**
> [Sprint D6](SPRINT-D6.md) and [Sprint D7](SPRINT-D7.md) must land first — both for real dependencies, listed below.

## Why this sprint is third

| ---------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| D6 C2      | S1 seeding tiebreak    | P/G won % is frozen at whatever was last written; every tiebreak resolves wrong                                                    |
| D6 C7      | S1 clean slate         | C7 deletes `selectGroupWinners` ([ruling 9](../../decisions/DECISIONS-2026-08-29.md)); S1 builds `seeding.ts` fresh rather than reviving a stub |
| D6 C1      | S2 RR knockout seeding | The knockout gate is pinned shut, so there is no knockout to seed                                                                  |
| D7 CS-3b   | S3 seed display        | No row slot exists; the number has nowhere to render                                                                               |

## S1 · The seeding engine · A3

**New file** · `src/features/tournament/domain/seeding.ts` — pure functions, no Firestore, unit-testable in isolation.

> **Knockouts only** (owner ruling 2026-08-31). Round Robin **group formation** is never seeded and keeps its own rule, zone then skill then courts. The knockout generated **from** those groups is still a knockout, so it is seeded, by the ordering in S2.

### Seed count

```ts
// Half the draw, capped at 10. 4→2, 8→4, 16→8, 32→10.
export const seedCount = (drawSize: number) => Math.min(Math.floor(drawSize / 2), 10);
```

### Ordering

Entry seeding is the live leaderboard position, computed from `leaguePoints26` at the moment of the join — not `stats.rankPosition`, which is a weekly snapshot and would seed a player on rank up to six days stale.

| Order | Criterion                                                                     |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | `leaguePoints26`, descending                                                  |
| 2     | P/G won % — `pointswon / totalPointsPlayed` (**needs [D6 C2](SPRINT-D6.md)**) |
| 3     | Name, ascending, case-insensitive                                             |

Rule 3 makes the order total: **no two players share a seed.** Join time is deliberately not a criterion — entering early earns nothing.

### Placement

The standard recursive anchor construction, so seeds meet as late as the draw allows:

```ts
// [1] → [1,2] → [1,4,2,3] → [1,8,4,5,2,7,3,6] …
// Seed 1 top, seed 2 in the opposite half, 3 and 4 anchoring the other quarters.
export const seedAnchors = (drawSize: number) => {
  let order = [1];
  while (order.length < drawSize) {
    const n = order.length * 2;
    order = order.flatMap((x) => [x, n + 1 - x]);
  }
  return order;
};
```

Byes go to the top seeds first. Unseeded players fill the remaining slots in entry order.

**Placement is automatic.** An 8 draw pairs **1v8, 4v5, 3v6, 2v7** (owner ruling 2026-08-31). Seeds 1 and 2 sit in opposite halves, so the semifinals are 1v4 and 2v3 and the top two can only meet in the final. The construction generalises to 16 and 32 unchanged. **After matches are generated the organizer may move unseeded players by hand**, see S4.

**Done when** · `seedCount` returns 2/4/8/10 for 4/8/16/32 · an 8-draw yields `[1,8,4,5,2,7,3,6]` · two players on equal points and equal P/G % order alphabetically · a third player joining above both renumbers them 2 and 3 · every function is covered by a unit test with no emulator.

---

## S2 · Wire seeding into the draws · A1 + A3

**Files** · `src/pages/tournament/rrGeneration.ts:361` (`buildRRKnockoutDocs`) · `:278` (`computeGroupStandings`) · `src/pages/tournament/types.ts:26-32`

1. `TournamentPlayer` gains `seed?: number`.
2. Order the knockout from `computeGroupStandings` using the new `seeding.ts`. `selectGroupWinners` is **deleted by [D6 C7](SPRINT-D6.md)** and is not revived ([ruling 9](../../decisions/DECISIONS-2026-08-29.md)).
3. `buildRRKnockoutDocs` places by `seedAnchors` rather than fill order.

**Round Robin knockout seeding** uses a different source from entry seeding, per the owner:

| Order | Criterion                                       |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Group points, across **all** groups in the draw |
| 2     | P/G won %                                       |
| 3     | Leaderboard rank                                |
| 4     | Name, ascending                                 |

No circularity here — group points and leaderboard rank are independent measures. (Entry seeding cannot use rule 3, because there the seed _is_ the leaderboard rank; that is why it falls straight to name.)

**Scope is one draw.** Draws split by zone × skill group × division, so seed 1 is the top player _in that bracket_. Seeding across zones would leave some draws with no seed 1 and others with several.

**`buildZoneTierGroups` (`src/pages/tournament/rrGeneration.ts:45`) is not touched.** Group formation stays zone → skill → courts (decision 6).

**Done when** · a generated knockout places seed 1 top and seed 2 in the opposite half · seeds 3 and 4 anchor the other quarters · byes land on the top seeds · regenerating the same draw produces the same bracket · group formation is byte-identical to D7.

---

## S3 · Seed display · A4

Render `(1)` before the name in the `seed` slot [D7 CS-3b](SPRINT-D7.md) provides. Only seeded players show a number; unseeded rows render nothing, not `(0)`.

The badge counts against group 7's two-stats-per-row budget at 360px. If a row already carries two numbers, the seed replaces one — it does not become a third.

**Done when** · seeded rows show the number in bracket, draw list and standings · unseeded rows show nothing · every row type still fits 360px.

---

## S4 · Seeds freeze at generation · A3

Before matches exist, seeds recompute on every join — a stronger player joining takes seed 1 and pushes everyone down. The moment the draw is generated, the seeding is fixed.

A later entrant takes an open slot and **renumbers nobody**. Nobody already playing is ever moved.

**Unseeded players stay movable.** Once the draw exists the organizer may move an **unseeded** player to another open position. Seeded players keep their number and their slot.

**Done when** · joining an ungenerated draw reorders the seeds · joining a generated draw changes no existing seed · the organizer can move an unseeded player to another open position after generation · a seeded player keeps their number and position · reseeding a generated draw stays forbidden.

**The coaching pool, as ruled 2026-08-31.** A coaching service offers three actions: **Book group lesson**, **Book**, and **Redeem discount**. Pooling is **not limited to socials**, it applies to any event that offers coaching. Bookings and offers gain a **type**: group classes, private classes, stringing, with room for more. **The old `group_lessons` collection is not coming back** (owner ruling 2026-08-31). [D6 C8](SPRINT-D6.md) deletes it and nothing in this sprint revives it. "Book group lesson" is an action on a coaching service, and a group lesson is a booking of **type** group classes. Nothing reads or writes the retired collection again.

**The coaching pool inherits five unanswered questions** from DATA_SHAPE §9 — the $20 vs $15 tiers, the "free 15/hr" contradiction, where the fee sits against `services` and `bookings`, and whether games hold state. **This sprint documents the target; it does not build it.**

## Also in this sprint

**Restore `stats.rankPosition`.** [DC-11](../../history/planning-2026-08-23/ACTION-REPORT.md#DC-11) deleted it as "written, rendered nowhere". That premise is wrong — `functions/rankSnapshot.js` writes it and `Leagues.tsx`, `Profile.tsx` and `useStandings.ts` all read it. Seeding gives it a second consumer.

**Update the data shape.** `tests/fixtures/shape-reference.mjs` and `scripts/build-sample-dataset.mjs` still encode the pre-D6 rulings. Seven corrections: `pointswon` and `totalPointsPlayed` restored, `tournamentsPlayed` kept with new meaning, `rankPosition` restored, `completion_requested_at` → `marked_completed_at`, the partner pool stored rather than derived, `result_application` retired, and D7's `points_winner` / `points_loser` added. `npm run dataset:build` must stay green.
