# DC00 — Dev-Anuj foundation evidence

DC00 is the completed foundation program that preceded the formal DC01–DC05 delivery sprints. It
groups the work into auditable workstreams; it does not invent calendar sprints or unrecorded effort.

## Reconciled scale

| Metric                 |    DC00 | Average DC01–DC05 | DC00 / later average |
| ---------------------- | ------: | ----------------: | -------------------: |
| Verified Git commits   |     121 |               3.2 |                37.8× |
| Changed-path footprint |   1,727 |              41.4 |                41.7× |
| First-party line churn |  38,530 |           1,510.6 |                25.5× |
| Total line churn       | 444,481 |           1,510.6 |               294.2× |

The total-churn figure includes the 1,351-path agent/tooling package with 380,105 additions, the
legacy `.claude` cleanup, and `package-lock.json`. The first-party metric excludes those three
categories and is the safer product-engineering comparison. The evidence therefore supports a
37.8-sprint commit-volume equivalent and a 25.5-sprint first-party-churn equivalent; it does not
support presenting one unqualified “50 sprints” claim.

## Completed workstreams

## Closed defect families

The delivery workbook assigns `BUG0020`–`BUG0034` to 15 completed defect families covering stats
ownership, provider-role elevation, Storage access, email safety, reward transitions, operational
guards, raw Firestore reads, signup persistence, event authority, client result paths, official
match/reward authority, workflow state, profile/contact/signup trust, browser determinism, and the
August 23 role/workflow conflicts.

## Validation evidence

The workbook records `VAL0030`–`VAL0044`: Git reconciliation, first-party scope reconciliation,
root and Functions unit coverage, Firestore and Storage Rules matrices, Functions emulator
integration, browser smoke, critical end-to-end journeys, static gates, and documentation evidence.
Current verifier attention, same-SHA reviews, staging, recovery, providers, deployment, and
production remain explicit backlog or external gates; no PASS or production claim is inferred.

Open work is maintained only in the [master backlog](../../history/BACKLOG-BLG.md), with future product work in
the [future-work register](../../deferred/FUTURE-WORK.md).
