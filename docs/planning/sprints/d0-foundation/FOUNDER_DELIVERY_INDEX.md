# Founder Technical Overview

> **Archive status (2026-08-25):** Completed `dev-anuj` takeover evidence. Every unfinished outcome
> identified here is represented in the active [master backlog](../../history/BACKLOG-BLG.md).

One visual reference for the current system, delivered engineering work, target state, validation
coverage, important technical documents, and open work on
[`dev-anuj`](https://github.com/tbtctennis/Racquets-And-Strings/tree/dev-anuj).

- **Last reviewed:** 2026-08-25
- **DC00 evidence window:** `4aaf515^..21ddf73`
- **DC00 delivery scale:** 121 commits, 1,727 changed paths, and 444,481 lines of total churn. The
  scoped first-party working set is 289 paths and 38,530 lines of churn. See the
  [DC00 foundation reconciliation](DC00-DEV-ANUJ-FOUNDATION.md) for definitions and comparisons.
- **Branch status:** Development work is delivered on `dev-anuj`
- **Review status:** Repository-local PASS is not yet declared. A complete clean verification run and
  four independent approvals on the same final commit remain pending.
- **Production status:** No production deployment, production data change, DNS change, credential
  configuration, or Firebase provider configuration was performed.

## How to read the status

| Status                       | Meaning                                                                                            |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Delivered**                | Implemented, committed, and present on the GitHub development branch.                              |
| **Pending local validation** | Repository work exists, but the final uninterrupted verifier and same-commit reviews remain open.  |
| **External gate**            | Requires approved staging, provider, backup, or production access. It is not a repository failure. |

```

### What changed from the earlier state

- The browser sends **intent** for protected actions. It no longer directly applies tournament
  points, statistics, rewards, offer economics, or advancement.
- `event_creator` is an **event workflow role**, not a global administrator. Event managers are
  limited to events they own or are explicitly assigned to.
- Important Firestore reads pass through runtime normalization before product code trusts them.
- Signup creates the profile, preferences, statistics, tasks, and contact records through one
  focused persistence boundary rather than inline route code.
- Local emulators, synthetic data, isolated ports, and browser journeys provide repeatable evidence
  without touching production.
- Migrations remain dry-run by default and require an explicit project and confirmation path.

## Current trust model: where important decisions happen

```mermaid

    Input[Browser input] --> Kind{What kind of action?}
    Kind -->|Ordinary profile or event intent| RuleCheck[Rules verify identity, ownership, and fields]
    Kind -->|Rewards, points, result, advancement| Callable[Authenticated callable or trigger]
    RuleCheck --> Allowed[(Allowed client-owned data)]
    Callable --> Validate[Validate caller, match, participants, score, state, and duplicate marker]
    Validate --> Transaction[Atomic server transaction]
    Transaction --> Protected[(Protected outcomes)]
    Validate -->|Invalid or unauthorized| Deny[Reject without applying changes]

    Private[Private preferences and contacts] --> PrivateRules[Owner or deliberate relationship access]
    PrivateRules --> Read[Bounded read]
    Private --> PublicProjection[Public preference projection]

    class Deny,Closed stop
```

### Founder takeaway

The main protection is no longer “the screen does not show that button.” The protection now lives
in Firestore Rules and server code, where a modified browser cannot bypass it.

## Quality coverage currently in the repository

    Verify --> Unit[Unit tests]
    Verify --> RulesTests[Rules tests]
    Verify --> Integration[Emulator integration]

    RulesTests --> Firestore[29 Firestore Rules tests]
    RulesTests --> Storage[5 Storage Rules tests]
    Integration --> FnIntegration[11 Functions integration tests]
    Integration --> Fixtures[4 Auth users and 32 Firestore documents]
    Browser --> Journeys[5 login, signup, join, scoring, advancement journeys]

    classDef gate fill:#eaf2f8,stroke:#2e74b5,color:#16324f

    class Verify,Static,Unit,RulesTests,Integration,Browser gate
    class StaticDetail,Root,Functions,Firestore,Storage,FnIntegration,Fixtures,Journeys evidence
```

These are configured reliable test counts. The final PASS claim still requires the complete verifier
to finish on one exact clean commit, followed by all four independent reviews of that same commit.

    class Dev,Fix work
    class Local,Reviews,SameSHA,Staging,Recovery,Approval gate
    class Deploy,Observe complete
    class Hold stop
```

### Target product boundaries still to add

- An explicit consent model before any cross-member preference projection is enabled.
- Bounded server operations for completed-result corrections and manual Round Robin bonus awards.
- Approved staging proof for App Check, account lookup, core user journeys, and configuration.
- A non-production backup and recovery rehearsal with recorded results.
- Dependency audit triage without broad or breaking upgrades.

## Update rule for this file

- Keep this as the single founder-facing technical overview and file inventory.
- Keep high-level current-state, target-state, and in-progress diagrams embedded here.
- Link deeper engineering diagrams instead of duplicating them here.
- Link only durable tracked files available on `dev-anuj`; exclude local-only review artifacts.
- Update the “last reviewed” date and status when the branch evidence changes.
- Refresh test counts only from current verifier output.
- Remove or replace links when files are renamed or retired.
- Never mark a review category PASS unless all four independent reviewers approve the same final
  clean commit.
