An in-app editor is a separate build   | DECISIONS_BRIEF §2; HARMONIZATION future works |
| Z2  | **One authoritative court roster generated from the shipped CSV.** Three hand-maintained lists drift today: the CSV (174 rows), `ZONE_COURT_COUNTS` (174), `functions/courts.json` (173 keys, North Scarborough 23 vs 24). | Open question Q-12 — which list is authoritative, and does a build script generate the other two | ACTION-REPORT Q-12, CS-39                      |

## 8 · Design system — the rows that need a decision before they can be built

Not deferred by choice. Each is blocked on an unsettled question, not a missing edit. The recommendation column is the audit's own; taking it turns the row from blocked into scheduled.

The licence permits 30px chips at `gap-2`; their expanded targets overlap by 6px and steal each other's taps                                                                                    | BT-9, BT-10, BT-17         | State it as an equation: gap ≥ (44 − painted height) on the expanded axis                                                                                                     |
| Q-3  | Does hit expansion apply to bracket and RR rows at all? Both licensed examples are zero-gap stacks whose vertical neighbours are themselves tappable — the case the same table forbids                                                           | BT-15                      | Re-scope the licence to horizontally adjacent controls only                                                                                                                   |
| Q-5  | DEC-4's "rounded edges" — 16px or a full pill?                                                                                                                                                                                                   | BT-22                      | **16px.** A pill collides with BT-22, which reserves `rounded-full` for non-tappable                                                                                          |
| Q-7  | What happens to the four hero type sizes? DEC-5 allows two; the marketing pages use `text-3xl`/`4xl`/`5xl`/`6xl`                                                                                                                                 | TY-2                       | Name one `display` exception at `text-3xl` for marketing                                                                                                                      |
| Q-11 | The BottomNav label. At `text-xs` + `tracking-widest`, "Marketplace" is ~78–92px in a 73px column at 375px, with no `truncate`                                                                                                                   | TY-8                       | Drop the tracking and add `truncate` — an exception in the one place it will keep being breached is not an exception                                                          |
| Q-12 | Which court roster is authoritative?                                                                                                                                                                                                             | CS-39, Z2                  | The CSV; generate the other two in a build script                                                                                                                             |
| Q-13 | What is an "active player" at a court? The client applies a 90-day / 0-points filter; the Cloud Function does not, so the same court shows a different count depending on whether the aggregate doc exists                                       | LB-14, CS-28               | Teach the function the client's rule — that is the number members have been reading                                                                                           |
| Q-14 | Keep or drop the Home baselines? "42 courts" never changes and is shown as fact; a genuine zero is indistinguishable from a failed read                                                                                                          | LB-13                      | Remove them.

| Q-15 | Does the Court Map join the design system? 60 hardcoded hex literals plus `system-ui` in one route                                                                                                                                               | CT-23, CT-27, CS-16, CS-44 | Full token sweep for the app-chrome half; a written fixed-light contract for the MapLibre half                                                                                |
| Q-17 | Keep the fixed 78px action slot? Half the call sites already defeat it with `w-auto`                                                                                                                                                             | CS-20                      | Keep it and trim the action clusters                                                                                                                                          |
| Q-18 | Avatar scale. 20px Navbar against 24px `ProviderAvatar` is an accident, not a decision                                                                                                                                                           | CS-17                      | Two sizes: `sm` 24 / `lg` 96                                                                                                                                                  |
| Q-20 | Ring denominators for the three Tasks headline tiles. RS Points and League Points are unbounded; Rewards is a bare count. A ring cannot be drawn without a denominator                                                                           | CS-33                      | No rings there — keep numerals                                                                                                                                                |

| Q-23 | Prose column width: 576px or 768px? Two published answers 192px apart for the same one-line commit                                                                                                                                               | —                          | 768px for prose, and the canon gains a second `page-shell` width                                                                                                              |
| Q-25 | Does signup collect the fields that later lock a member out? It accepts empty `preferred_courts` and `league` — exactly the state that blocks `/matches`. `skillLevel` defaults to 2, so "never answered" and "I am a 2.0" are indistinguishable | —                          | Collect them, and make the skill default absent rather than 2                                                                                                                 |

## 9 · What is **not** here

Two things people expect to find in a future-work list and will not:

- **The 273 UI action rows.** They are scheduled — Sprint 3 for the foundation, Sprint 5 for the component system. Only the rows blocked on §8's questions are unscheduled, and they are listed by their blocking question, not individually.
- **Anything on the freeze list.** `CompleteProfileModal`, the day-toggle grid, the scheduling trio, the no-show cluster, the Services Dispute/Cancel controls, `GroupLessonCard`, `OPEN_STATUSES`, the super-admin `AddServiceForm`. These are **deleted**, not deferred. See `PROJECT-PLAN.md` §8.
