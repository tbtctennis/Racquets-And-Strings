> **Amendment — 2026-08-23 · results auto-apply on submission.** Owner ruling, affecting every
> section below that assumes an organizer approval step. A submitted result **applies immediately**;
> both players are notified (winner _"Win recorded — {score}"_, loser _"Score recorded — {score}"_).
> Two submissions with the **same winner but different scores** resolve to the one with the
> **smaller aggregate winning margin** — `7-0, 7-0` (14) against `7-2, 7-4` (8) records `7-2, 7-4`;
> tie → first submission stands. Only **different winners** flag for review, and the first submitted
> result stays applied and displayed until the organizer resolves it. Applies to tournaments,
> ladder challenges and friendlies alike. **Walkovers remain organizer-only.** Supersedes
> `HARMONIZATION_REPORT.md` D4. Authoritative text: `docs/PROJECT-PLAN.md` §2.

## 1. Walkovers only — no-show removed

- The no-show concept is removed. The only non-played result is a **walkover**: scores `0-0, 0-0, 0-0` with a winner.
- Walkovers exist in **tournaments only**. Ladder and friendly results must be real scores; the validators reject all-zero results there.
- Payout: in a **Round Robin group a walkover pays 1 point to each player** (it is not a played result). In a **knockout** the winner advances and the eliminated player collects that round's award.
- **A no-show is not a walkover.** If one player fails to appear for a scheduled match, the organizer records a real **6-0** score for the player who showed up, paid as a normal result. The walkover covers a match neither player played.
- Model: `no_show` is removed from matches. `is_walkover` is not stored — it is derivable (all-zero scores + winner).
- Removed with it: the organizer's "Count As No Show" control, the no-show branch of the points logic, and the `is_walkover` cross-check in the result callable (the defect logged against it is moot).

## 2. Zone at join

- A member with **no court preferences** who clicks Join gets a court dropdown modal titled **"Enter A Zone"**. The join completes only after courts are chosen; the chosen courts set `preferred_zone`; the server placer then seats them within their zone's draws.
- **Custom court entries** (a court that resolves to no zone): notify the super-admin and the event organizer. A manual check verifies where the court is, its details are added to the courts map, and the zone resolves from there. Assumption: map additions ship as data updates to the courts dataset; a runtime-editable map is future work.
- Outcome: nobody is defaulted to Downtown-Midtown silently. Today the code defaults a zone-less member there at placement, and the organizer only sees "No zone" in the Unplaced list.

## 3. Bookings lifecycle (stringing)

- Statuses: **`lead → in_progress → completed`**, plus **`cancelled`** (reachable from `lead` only).
- A lead is created when the player books the service. Under the same stringer in Services the player gets **"Racquet dropped"** → `in_progress`.
- The stringer sees **"Completed"** on in-progress jobs. Clicking it notifies the player — _"Got your racquet back?"_ — with a yes/no form. **Yes** → `completed`. **No** → stays `in_progress`, the stringer sees "Completed" again, and the super-admin is notified _"Name (Player) cancelled job completion"_. No fourth status: while waiting, the booking carries a `completion_requested_at` stamp.
- **Cancel before drop-off:** the player cancels a lead → `cancelled`, points refunded.
- The old `flagged` / `cancel_requested` review states are removed.

## 4. Contact and profile access

- Contact details are readable in-app by exactly two parties: **the event organizer, for members signed up to their event** (participant-join connections), and **opponents through connections**. Nobody else — the super-admin's in-app access to other members' profiles and contacts is removed. The owner's full-data access is the database export.
- Admin functions (review queues, notifications) are unchanged; only profile viewing is removed.
- Members can open the profiles of people in their tournament or group from the Profiles page; a link from the tournament display is future work.

## 5. Withdrawal

- **Member:** a joined event shows a **Withdraw** button. Before draws exist, withdrawing leaves the roster. After draws exist: warning _"You lose all matches — opponents get walkovers"_ → confirm → every unplayed match becomes a walkover (Round Robin: 1 point each; knockout: opponent advances). Played matches stay as played. Permanent from the member's side. The organizer is notified _"Name withdraws from [tournament] [division]"_.
- **Organizer:** a **Reset** control replaces the delete bin; an **orange !** button next to it opens the withdrawal form (reason: injury, unavailable, cannot contact, other) and writes `status: withdrawn` + the note. Withdrawn players stay in Unplaced and are never auto-seated.
- **Re-add** after a mistaken withdrawal is allowed. Applied walkovers are not auto-reversed — the organizer corrects each affected match with a normal rescore.

## 6. Scheduling

- Confirmed: no dates or times are stored. The date-bearing scheduled-match indexes retire with the scheduling fields.

Notifications (in-app / push) are the primary update channel, to reduce email. Offline: none — every action is online-only.                                                                                                                                                            |

## Future works (UI)

- "Enter A Zone" join modal; unmapped-court notification and verification flow; runtime-editable courts map.
- Services: "Racquet dropped" and "Completed" buttons, the "Got your racquet back?" yes/no form, lead cancellation.
- Withdraw button (member); Reset control and the orange ! withdrawal-form button (organizer); withdrawal notification.
- Tournament-display link to co-member profiles; organizer overview contact button; bracket-image contact column.
- Organizer-assignment UI (after the providers collection).
- Mobile app vs PWA decision; push notifications as the primary update channel.
- Staging tier and the backup/restore policy details (PD7, PD8 — deferred by the owner).
