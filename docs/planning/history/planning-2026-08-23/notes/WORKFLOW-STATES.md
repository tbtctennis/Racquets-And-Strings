| **Reviewed**  | `tbtc/dev-anuj` @ `9c81f00`, against every decision in `docs/notes/` and `docs/sprints/`                                                                                                                           |
| **Method**    | **Now** is read from source and cited to a file. **Target** is read from the decision records and cited to its ruling. Where a decision document contradicts the code, the gap is named rather than smoothed over. |
| **Companion** | `PROJECT-PLAN.md` (who and when) · `FUTURE-WORK.md` (what is not scheduled) · this file (what the machine does, before and after)                                                                                  |

**Key:** ✅ built · ⚠️ built but wrong · ❌ absent · **[Sprint D1](../../../sprints/d1-d5/SPRINT-D1.md)–[D5](HARMONIZATION_REPORT.md#D5)** = the sprint that changes it.

## 0 · The data deltas, in one table

Every stored-field change decided across the notes. This is the spine — most workflow changes below are a consequence of one of these rows.

  disputed --> complete: organizer rescore resolves it · flag cleared
  complete --> complete: organizer rescore, unlimited (D3)

  note right of disputed
    score_disputed is a FLAG, not a status.
    The first submitted result stays applied
    and stays on the card while disputed.
    Advancement is NOT rolled back.

**Margin** = Σ(winner's games) − Σ(loser's games) across all sets.

**Worked case.** QF, Chandra beat Rahul. Chandra submits `7-0, 7-0` → margin **14**, applied, Chandra → SF, Rahul banks **QF = 3**. Rahul submits `7-2, 7-4` → margin **8**. `8 < 14`, so **`7-2, 7-4` records**.

> **Finding F-M — after [L14](HARMONIZATION_REPORT.md#L14) and [S1](HARMONIZATION_REPORT.md#S1), a same-winner reconcile has no stat consequences at all.** Once `pointswon`, `totalPointsPlayed` and `loses` stop being stored, every remaining stat delta (`matchesPlayed`, `wins`, `leaguePoints26`, `league`) depends only on **winner + round + format** — never on games. So row 6's "reverse + reapply" is a **pure score-field update**; the stat reversal is a no-op. The full reverse-then-reapply is only genuinely needed when **the winner changes**. Worth knowing before anyone builds the expensive path for the common case.

**Guards that survive from [D4](HARMONIZATION_REPORT.md#D4):** a winner flip is **refused with a message** when the next match already holds a completed or submitted result. Approval never overwrites a played slot.

### 1.3 Entry guards — now

Guard 12 becomes `status !== 'withdrawn'` in [Sprint D4](../../../sprints/d1-d5/SPRINT-D4.md) — see **F-B**.

### 1.4 Advancement — unchanged by the remodel

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A["result applied"] --> C{"next_match_id set?"}
  C -->|no| Z["no advancement"]
  C -->|yes| D["query matches by event_id + match_id,<br/>filter by sameDraw()"]
  D --> E{"found?"}
  E -->|no| F["THROW"]
  E -->|yes| G{"next.status complete?"}

  G -->|no| H{"next_slot valid?"}

  I --> J
  J --> K{"slot held by a different uid?"}
  K -->|yes| F
  K -->|no| L["write winner uid + name"]
```

`sameDraw` compares `bracket ?? null`, `tournament_choice`, `division`, `skill_group`, **`zone ?? null`**. ✅ The zone normalization is present — template match ids repeat across zone draws, and without it a winner lands in the wrong zone's slot.

## 2 · Score validation

| #   | Rule                                     | Callable | Rules              | Form            | Target                          |

| 5   | Walkover ⇒ all zero                      | ✅       | —                  | auto-derived ⚠️ | explicit switch, organizer-only |
| 6   | All-zero and not flagged ⇒ reject        | ✅       | —                  | —               | unchanged                       |
| 7   | No-show only in RR group                 | ✅       | —                  | ✅              | **rule deleted with `no_show`** |
| 8   | Court name ≤ 200 chars                   | ✅       | —                  | —               | unchanged                       |

The twelve contract examples: **valid** `4-3` `7-2` `7-5` `8-4` `9-3` `10-4` `24-22` `38-40` `94-92` · **invalid** `12-2` `40-0` `90-40`.

> **F-E.** The set-majority half is built. The **margin-of-2 rule exists in no layer** — `12-2` and `90-40` pass the callable today. Meanwhile the rules cap player submissions at 0–7, so `8-4` and `24-22` are rejected at the boundary while passing at the callable. Three layers, three answers.

### The [LB-1](../ACTION-REPORT.md#LB-1) chain, traced

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A["useTournament.ts:1826<br/>winnerUserId = player_1_uid<br/>pre-seeded on open"] --> B["Submit pressed immediately,<br/>nothing entered"]
  B --> C["scoreSubmission.ts:61<br/>isWalkover = every set 0-0<br/>→ TRUE, silently"]
  C --> D["walkover:true passes the server guard"]
  D --> E["RR: winner +3, loser +1,<br/>matchesPlayed +1, win/loss recorded"]
```

> **F-H.** The server _would_ have caught this — it rejects an all-zero result that is **not** flagged as a walkover. The client is the only reason it is reachable: it derives the flag automatically. Fixing the seed closes it; an explicit organizer-only Walkover switch closes it permanently.

`winnerPointsApply = rr || isFinal` — **a knockout winner scores only by taking the final.** Losing in the QF banks 3, and that is the player's entire return from the knockout.

**Target `matchAward` decision table:**

| #   | Condition                                     |   Winner |                        Loser |

`matchAward` and `computeGroupStandings` must carry this identically and **change in one commit** — they have already drifted once, and the group table paid a phantom +5 nobody had received.

### 3.2 Stat fields per result — now vs target

| `loses`             | —                      | +1               | **derived** — `matchesPlayed − wins`; **both writers stop** ([S1](HARMONIZATION_REPORT.md#S1)) |

> **F-D.** `tournamentsPlayed` increments on **every loss** — the loser branch adds it unconditionally, the winner only on the final. Five losses reads as "5 tournaments played". DC-12 deletes it, but nobody recorded that the stored value is actively wrong.

> **F-C — this is the one that moves a sprint.** `pointswon` and `totalPointsPlayed` are written **by the server on every result**, not only at bootstrap. The strip migration must run **after** the writer stops, or the next scored match re-creates them. **[Sprint D1](../../../sprints/d1-d5/SPRINT-D1.md)'s L14 scoping is incomplete — it belongs with the result path in [D2](HARMONIZATION_REPORT.md#D2)/D3.** Same shape for `loses` under S1: two writers (result deltas and friendly payout) must stop together.

### 3.3 Balances

`L9`/`PD1`: **only `points_spent` is stored.** Totals and balances are derived at read. Anything currently persisting a balance is a candidate for deletion in [Sprint D5](../../../sprints/d1-d5/SPRINT-D5.md).

## 4 · Join and slot allocation

### 4.1 Now — `slotStatus` gates the join

| #     | Condition                                                  | Outcome                                                       |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Not a tournament, no division, or **no matches generated** | `null` — register freely                                      |
| 2     | `tournament_format === 'rr'` or any RR match               | **`null` — RR bypasses the gate entirely**                    |
| 3     | Singles + seniors                                          | slot in `Retired Pro` → `available` else `full`               |
| 4     | Singles, merged draw (`skill_group === 'All'`)             | slot in `All` → `available` else `full`                       |
| 5     | Singles, skill ≥ 4                                         | intended `Masters`, alternate `Challengers`                   |
| 6     | Singles, skill < 4                                         | intended `Challengers`, alternate `Masters`                   |
| 7     | Slot free in the intended group                            | `available`                                                   |
| 8     | Slot free in the **alternate** group                       | ⚠️ **`fallback`** — sets `skillOverride` to **4 or 3**        |
| 9     | Neither                                                    | **`full`** — join refused                                     |
| 10–11 | Doubles                                                    | consolidated `Doubles/All/All`, else `Doubles/{division}/All` |

Open slot = `player_N_name` is `PLAYER_LOADING` or `BYE`. Zone filter: `if (myZone && (m.zone ?? undefined) !== myZone) continue`.

> **F-I — the fallback rewrites the player's skill.** Row 8 returns `skillOverride: altGroup === 'Masters' ? 4 : 3`. **A player's recorded skill changes because of which slot happened to be free.** Same class as [LB-17](../ACTION-REPORT.md#LB-17), and the strongest argument for skill-as-a-join-time-snapshot.

### 4.2 Target — joining always registers

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  J["member taps Join"] --> Z{"has preferred_courts?"}
  Z -->|no| M["'Enter A Zone' modal — join BLOCKS until courts chosen"]
  M --> R{"court resolves to a zone?"}
  R -->|no| N["notify super-admin + organizer<br/>court verified by hand, added to the dataset"]
  R -->|yes| S
  Z -->|yes| S["participant row created — ALWAYS"]
  S --> P{"server placer, on participant-create"}
  P -->|draw generated| A["seat into an open LOADING slot<br/>or an RR group WITHIN THEIR ZONE"]
  P -->|not generated| B["zone-assigned; preferred_zone routes them at generation"]
  P -->|withdrawn or organizer-removed| C["stays in Unplaced — NEVER re-seated"]
```

**No "draw is full" refusal. No fallback prompt. No skill rewrite.** Groups stay capped at 5 (`RR_GROUP_MAX`); `overGroupCap` guards every manual path. The in-browser late-join placer is **deleted** — two auto-placers used to fight over this and a player's group depended on whether an organizer had a browser tab open.

---

## 5 · Zone change _(new — [L15](HARMONIZATION_REPORT.md#L15))_

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A["member changes zone<br/>(profile Zone section, or per-event request)"] --> B{"matches generated<br/>in this event?"}
  B -->|no| C["MOVES FREELY — silent.<br/>preferred_zone alone routes them at generation"]
  B -->|yes| D{"does the new zone already have<br/>a draw they'd belong to?"}
  D -->|no| E["silent. They keep their existing draw,<br/>and route into the new zone when it generates"]
  D -->|yes| F["organizer notified.<br/>Player sits in BOTH zone draws.<br/>Appears in Unplaced for the new zone"]
  F --> G{"organizer resolves"}
  G --> H["displace"]
  G --> I["add to both draws — DEFAULT"]
  G --> J["cancel"]
```

**A zone change never unseats anyone.** Existing matches are untouched — the player keeps playing every one of them. This is why `unplacedParticipants` tests seating **per draw**, not per event: a zone-changer is seated in their old draw and unseated in the new one, and only the second fact matters.

An explicit pick sets **`preferred_zone_manual`**, which stops a later court edit silently recomputing `preferred_zone` and moving them between draws.

**Two zone paths, deliberately different:** the tournament page's "Request Zone Change" is per-event and _notify-only_; the profile card's Zone section writes `preferences.preferred_zone` directly with no organizer in the loop.

Needs `firebase deploy --only functions:onZoneChanged`.

## 6 · Doubles partner _(new — [L18](HARMONIZATION_REPORT.md#L18))_

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> registered_alone: join Doubles with no partner
  [*] --> paired_member: join with partner_uid
  [*] --> paired_guest: join with partner_name only (not on the app)

  registered_alone --> pool: added to this event's partner pool
  pool --> pool: someone new joins → every pool member notified
  pool --> paired_member: a player picks them from the pool dropdown<br/>BOTH removed from the pool
  paired_member --> pool: team edited — the released player returns to the pool

  note right of pool
    The pool IS the dropdown other players pick from —
    not every player on the app.
    The notification links to the pool list,
    with contact buttons per row.
  end note
```

One `setDoublesPartner` writes either shape. For a member partner the **server creates their own participant row**, and partner uids sit on the match doc — so a partner on the app can read the opponents' contacts and submit scores. A guest partner has no uid and gets none of that.

## 7 · Ladder challenge

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> open: createChallenge — cap 3 active, 7-day cooldown per pair
  open --> accepted: respondChallenge(true)
  open --> rejected: respondChallenge(false)
  open --> rejected: bare updateDoc status rejected
  accepted --> reported: reportChallenge
  reported --> confirmed: confirmChallenge — TRANSACTION
  confirmed --> [*]
  rejected --> [*]
```

| Guard                | Value                                                                           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Active challenge cap | **3**                                                                           |
| Cooldown per pair    | **7 days**                                                                      |
| Points               | **±3**, loser floored at 0                                                      |
| Idempotency          | `applied === true \|\| status === 'confirmed'` read **inside** `runTransaction` |

✅ The floor needs a read-then-write, and it is correctly a transaction — in a plain batch two concurrent confirms both read the same starting value and one −3 is silently lost.
⚠️ But `confirmChallenge` **writes stats from the client**, which the branch's own rules deny — so **every confirm fails today**.

**Target ([Sprint D2](../../../sprints/d1-d5/SPRINT-D2.md)):** a `challengeResults` callable, authorized by the **ladder event's manager**, and the auto-apply rule applies here too — a reported challenge applies on submission, with the same margin reconcile and dispute flag. Challenges keep `event_id`; `events/ladder` is a permanent document.

> **F-L.** `rejected` has two writers with no shared guard.

---

## 8 · Friendly / rally

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> open: createRally
  open --> accepted: respondRally(true)
  open --> declined: respondRally(false)
  open --> [*]: cancelRally — HARD DELETE
  accepted --> reported: reportRally
  reported --> confirmed: resolveRally(true) by the OTHER player
  reported --> disputed: resolveRally(false)
  confirmed --> [*]: pays +2 / +1
  disputed --> [*]: NO EXIT
```

The payout trigger requires **all** of: category `rally` both sides · `reported → confirmed` · `event_id` and both uids unchanged · `reported_by` set · `confirmed_by` set, **different from `reported_by`**, and one of the two players · scores integers **0–7** · winner is a player.

> **F-K — `disputed` is a dead end.** Nothing transitions out, and no organizer path resolves it. A disputed rally is stuck with no points and no route forward. **The auto-apply ruling covers friendlies**, so [Sprint D2](../../../sprints/d1-d5/SPRINT-D2.md) should replace this state with the dispute flag + organizer rescore that tournaments get — otherwise the app keeps two different answers to the same question.

> **Note.** `cancelRally` **deletes the document**. Every other workflow transitions a status, and `D1` treats the change log as the audit. A deleted rally leaves no trace.

## 9 · RR group bonus _(new — [conflict 4](DEV_ANUJ_CONFLICTS.md#4-round-robin-group-bonus--broken))_

```mermaid

Today `handleSetGroupBonus` is a **stub that throws**. Target: a `setGroupBonus` callable with a manager check, stamping and paying in one transaction.

## 10 · Participant lifecycle

### 10.1 Now — two vocabularies

| Check               | Field read                                             | Where                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Result callable     | `participant.removal !== true`                         | `tournamentResults.js` |
| Connections trigger | `!['withdrawn','removed','inactive'].includes(status)` | `connections.js:103`   |

> **F-B.** Two independent definitions of "active". **A participant marked `status: 'withdrawn'` is still scoreable by the result callable.** `S3` names only one call site — both must change or [Sprint D4](../../../sprints/d1-d5/SPRINT-D4.md) fixes half the problem.

### 10.2 Target — one `status`, and walkovers on withdrawal

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> active: join
  active --> withdrawn: member Withdraw, or organizer orange-!
  withdrawn --> active: organizer re-add — ALLOWED
  withdrawn --> withdrawn: stays REGISTERED, stays in Unplaced, never auto-seated
```

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  W["withdrawal confirmed"] --> D{"draws generated?"}
  D -->|no| L["simply leaves the roster"]
  D -->|yes| M["warning: 'You lose all matches — opponents get walkovers'"]
  M --> N["every UNPLAYED match becomes a walkover<br/>applied THROUGH THE RESULT PATH, not by direct writes"]
  N --> O["RR group: 1 point to EACH player"]
  N --> P["knockout: opponent advances,<br/>withdrawing player collects that round's award<br/>R32 1 · R16 2 · QF 3 · SF 5 · F 10"]
  N --> Q["PLAYED matches stay played — untouched"]
  Q --> R["notify organizer, member, and every affected opponent"]
```

**Permanent from the member's side.** Re-add is allowed, but **applied walkovers are not auto-reversed** — the organizer corrects each by a normal rescore.

One `status` field replaces the removal flag, the RR withdrawn list **and** both active checks above.

> The old removal path purged the player from the **whole event** and deregistered them, and the withdrawn-list update had to ride the **same batch** as the match-doc changes — written separately, the matches change reached `onSnapshot` first and the just-removed player was re-seated, persisting across a reload. The `status` field removes the need for that choreography entirely.

Writes: owner only, whitelisted through `ownerContactFields()` with `hasOnly()`. Delete is `if false`.

**An open request earns nothing** — otherwise anyone could harvest a phone number by firing off a challenge nobody answers.

`pairId = (a,b) => a < b ? a__b : b__a` exists in **both** `connections.js:34` and `firestore.rules` and must stay byte-identical, or every contact read in the app starts failing.

> **Consequence for all client code: a denied `contacts` read is normal, not an error.** The connection document lands a moment _after_ a request is accepted. `.catch()` each read individually — a batched `Promise.all` turns one expected denial into zero contacts on the page. _([LB-3](../ACTION-REPORT.md#LB-3), [LB-4](../ACTION-REPORT.md#LB-4).)_

> **F-J.** `isCurrentGroupLessonCoachFor` is a **fourth** reader that `DEV_ANUJ_CONFLICTS` §5 omits — it describes the rule as "owner / connection / super-admin". It retires in Sprint D5, so the contacts rule has a cross-sprint dependency: remove the predicate in the same change or it dangles.

`public_contacts` is maintained by `onContactProjection` as a **field projection**, not the marker the docs describe.

## 13 · Round Robin groups and the knockout

### 13.1 Group formation — `buildZoneTierGroups`

| #   | Condition                                                                 | Outcome                                           |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Draw has **≤ 5 players**                                                  | **one group**; zone and band ignored              |
| 2   | Otherwise                                                                 | bucket by skill band, then preferred-court zone   |
| 3   | Lone player in a distinct zone, and **> 3** zone-clustered groups already | own placeholder group                             |
| 4   | Lone player in a distinct zone, otherwise                                 | pooled with the band, ordered by zone, then split |
| 5   | Each bucket                                                               | `splitEvenly(n)` — `g = ceil(n/5)`, groups of 3–5 |

`splitEvenly`: 5→[5] · 6→[3,3] · 7→[4,3] · 8→[4,4] · 9→[5,4] · 10→[5,5] · 11→[4,4,3] · 12→[4,4,4].
Bands: Beginners 2–2.5 · Challengers 3–3.5 · Masters 4–5. **The size algorithm is authoritative and is never overridden by band boundaries.**

### 13.2 Knockout gate — `rrKnockoutReady`

```js
rrGroupMatches.length > 0 && rrGroupMatches.every((m) => m.status === 'complete') && rrKnockoutMatches.length === 0;
```

⚠️ **No placeholder exclusion.** A one-player group legitimately keeps a placeholder match so the lone player stays visible and movable — that placeholder is never `complete`, so **the gate is pinned shut forever**, with no message and no way to clear it. _([LB-2](../ACTION-REPORT.md#LB-2), [Sprint D1](../../../sprints/d1-d5/SPRINT-D1.md): add `m.player_1_uid && m.player_2_uid`.)_

### 13.3 Seeding and the size bar

|                  | Now                                                                                                 | Target ([R-4](../ACTION-REPORT.md#R-4), [Sprint D4](../../../sprints/d1-d5/SPRINT-D4.md))                                |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Seeding          | `selectGroupWinners` auto-seeds every group winner, ordered points → gamesWon, top seed into slot 1 | **All slots generate as `PLAYER_LOADING`.** No ordering                                                      |
| Slot editability | The top seed is engine-placed and reads as authoritative                                            | **Every slot reassignable**, including a group's first-ranked player                                         |
| Size             | chosen per generation                                                                               | organizer-only, **expand-only** 4→8→16, never backward; existing matches retained; confirmed via Manage Draw |
| Runner-up fill   | already removed                                                                                     | stays removed                                                                                                |

### 13.4 Reset scoping — target

**Reset or cancel must touch exactly one draw** — this knockout, this RR, this division, this league. Never the whole tournament. **Recorded scores are never deleted.**

`currentMatches` **must filter on `zone`**: every destructive path iterates it, and without the zone term two zone draws in the same division and skill are indistinguishable — resetting one zone **deleted the other zone's matches and reversed those players' league points.**

---

## 14 · Scheduling _([P3](WORKFLOW_DESIGN_REPORT.md#P3), [Sprint D4](../../../sprints/d1-d5/SPRINT-D4.md))_

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A["player taps Schedule"] --> B["client writes requested_by"]
  B --> C["OPPONENT is nudged,<br/>carrying the requester's contact channels"]
  C --> D["they arrange it between themselves"]
  E["organizer"] --> F["READ-ONLY requests panel,<br/>beside per-round deadlines"]
```

**No dates or times are stored.** The date-bearing scheduled-match indexes retire; the organizer's date / AM-PM / Set controls and their two toasts are deleted; the Profile day-toggle grid goes with them.

**Deadlines** are keyed by **draw and round** and **exclude the RR group stage** — it runs the season. RR **knockout** rounds carry them. The weekly reminder carries the nearest one: _"You have 3 matches to play — earliest deadline 14 Sept"_, falling back to _"Arrange a time with your opponent."_ when the player has no dated match.

**No `requested_by` backfill** ([S5](HARMONIZATION_REPORT.md#S5)) — the old boolean never recorded who asked, so pending requests expire and players re-request.

## 15 · Bookings

### 15.1 Now — coupon states

| Transition      | Allowed from                  |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `use`           | `active`, `flagged`           |
| `flag`          | `active`                      |
| `cancelRequest` | `active`                      |
| `reviewApprove` | `cancel_requested`            |
| `reviewDecline` | `flagged`, `cancel_requested` |

### 15.2 Target — [L11](HARMONIZATION_REPORT.md#L11), [Sprint D5](../../../sprints/d1-d5/SPRINT-D5.md)

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> lead: player books the service
  lead --> in_progress: player taps "Racquet dropped"
  lead --> cancelled: player cancels — POINTS REFUNDED
  in_progress --> awaiting: stringer taps "Completed"<br/>completion_requested_at stamped — a STAMP, not a status
  awaiting --> completed: player answers Yes
  awaiting --> in_progress: player answers No → super-admin notified<br/>"{Name} (Player) cancelled job completion"
  cancelled --> [*]
  completed --> [*]
```

**`cancelled` is reachable from `lead` only.** There is no fourth status. `flagged`, `cancel_requested` and `redemption_locks` are all removed. The catalog moves to `services` behind an owner-gated callable.

## 16 · Status vocabulary

| Ladder challenge | `open` · `accepted` · `rejected` · `reported` · `confirmed`              | auto-apply; dispute flag replaces the review step  |
| Rally            | `open` · `accepted` · `declined` · `reported` · `confirmed` · `disputed` | same — `disputed` should become the shared flag    |
| Coupon / booking | `active` · `flagged` · `cancel_requested` · `used`                       | `lead` · `in_progress` · `completed` · `cancelled` |
| Claim            | `pending` · `approved` · `rejected`                                      | unchanged                                          |
| Join slot        | `available` · `fallback` · `full`                                        | **all three deleted** — joining always registers   |
| Participant      | `removal` flag / `withdrawn`·`removed`·`inactive`                        | **one `status`**: `active` · `withdrawn`           |

**Three near-synonym pairs across domains:** `rejected` (ladder, claim) vs `declined` (rally) · `complete` (match) vs `confirmed` (ladder, rally) vs `used` (coupon) · `removal`/`removed`/`withdrawn`/`inactive` for one participant idea. `CS-24` asks for one four-word match vocabulary; it should cover the cross-domain pairs too, not just the match card.

## 18 · What is not covered here

- `useTournament.ts` in full — ~2,600 lines on this branch. The result, bonus, knockout-gate and zone paths are covered; the draw-editor and subscription halves are not.
- **`firestore.rules` end to end.** I read the `contacts`, `stats` and score-bound sections only. **A full rules pass is worth doing before [Sprint D2](../../../sprints/d1-d5/SPRINT-D2.md) ships** — that file is the API layer, and the auto-approval change opens a callable to a new class of caller.
- Court Map, Tasks and Marketplace — no multi-state lifecycle, so no diagram would earn its place.
- Anuj's build quality — deliberately out of scope, same as `UI-REMAINING.md`.
