| <a id="D1"></a>D1 | **No submissions collection.** Player reports are a pending block on the match doc; the `tournament` change log (actor, before/after) is the audit. The owner reads it through the CSV exporter (`tournament` added to `analysis/export-firestore.js`).                                                                                                                              |

| <a id="D5"></a>D5 | **One server-side placer** on participant-create seats joiners within their zone's draws (open LOADING slot or RR group; zone-assigned at join before generation).

| <a id="D6"></a>D6 | **Walkovers only.** No-show is removed. A walkover is all-zero scores plus a winner, tournaments only; `is_walkover` is not stored. **Payout:** a Round Robin group walkover pays **1 point to each player**; a knockout walkover advances the winner and the eliminated player collects that round's award.                                                                         |

### Amendment — 2026-08-23 · results auto-apply on submission

**Owner ruling. Replaces D4 and the review half of §2.** Authoritative text: `docs/PROJECT-PLAN.md` §2.

- A player submits a winner and a score. **It applies immediately** — no organizer approval step. Points paid, stats written, knockout winner advanced.
- **Both players are notified.** Winner: _"Win recorded — {score} v. {opponent}"_. Loser: _"Score recorded — {score} v. {opponent}"_.
- **Same winner, different scores** → the submission with the **smaller aggregate winning margin** is recorded, reverse-then-reapply in one transaction. Σ(winner's games) − Σ(loser's games); tie → first submission stands. Worked case: `7-0, 7-0` (margin 14) against `7-2, 7-4` (margin 8) → **`7-2, 7-4` records**.
- **Different winners** → nothing changes. **The first submitted result stays applied and displayed.** The match flags, both players see _"Result disputed — organizer reviewing"_, the organizer is notified once and resolves by rescore (D3).
- **Scope: all three** — tournament matches, ladder challenges (±3) and friendlies (+2/+1).
- **Walkovers stay organizer-only.** A player-submitted all-zero result is rejected.
- **L3 amended:** `score_pending` retires; the idempotency hash moves inside `result_submissions`, a map keyed by submitter uid carrying winner, sets, margin, timestamp and hash.
- **Unchanged:** validation (0–99, margin exactly 2 above 10, set majority, winner named), D3's unlimited organizer rescore, and the refusal to overwrite a played slot in the next round.

## 2. Scoring and review contract (Phase 4b)

Set scores are integers 0–99; when the higher score exceeds 10 the margin must be exactly 2; a walkover is all zeros; the winner takes the set majority. Every score field is server-written.

| Valid                                              | Invalid           |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| 4-3, 7-2, 7-5, 8-4, 9-3, 10-4, 24-22, 38-40, 94-92 | 12-2, 40-0, 90-40 |

- **Walkover payout:** Round Robin group — 1 point each; knockout — winner advances, eliminated player collects the round award. A player who fails to appear for a scheduled match is **not** a walkover: the organizer records a real 6-0 result, paid normally.
- **Approving a change on a knockout match:** if the next match already holds a completed or submitted result the approval is refused with a message; otherwise the change is approved and the new winner replaces the player in the next match's slot.
- **Group bonus:** organizer toggle pays +5 to every member, reverses on toggle-off; the `rr_groupbonus` stamp is the receipt (pay only if unstamped, reverse only if stamped).
- **Ladder:** `challengeResults`, authorized by the ladder event's manager, same score rule, same pending → confirmed lifecycle.

| <a id="S1"></a>S1 | The `loses` strip lands in Phase 4b, where both writers stop (result deltas, friendly payout).                                                                                  | 4b    |
| <a id="S2"></a>S2 | Add `tournamentResults.js` to the touched list — it writes `rr_winner_pts_v2`.                                                                                                  | 1     |

| <a id="S4"></a>S4 | Events rename: `isCreatorOfEvent()` is stale — `creator_id` is read by `isManagerOfEvent` / `isOwnerOfEvent`, the events rules pins, `isEventOrganizer`, `onScheduleRequested`. | 2a    |
| <a id="S5"></a>S5 | No `requested_by` backfill (the boolean never recorded who asked); pending requests expire, players re-request.                                                                 | 3     |
| <a id="S6"></a>S6 | The `event_creator` fallback ends at the `providers` cutover, not at Lockdown.                                                                                                  | 5     |

## Future works

- Organizer-assignment UI and audit trail over `organizer_ids` (after `providers`).
- Recompute-and-diff reconciliation tooling in the migrations framework.
- Runtime-editable courts map.
- Uniform null-filled schemas (deferred standard).
- Staging tier, backup policy details, mobile path — decisions deferred (see `DECISIONS_BRIEF.md`).
