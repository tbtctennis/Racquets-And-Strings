# Deferred work and future sprints

> **Status: deferred.** Product work ruled out of D6–D9, plus files that do not exist yet.
> Live post-staging ids: [`docs/development/BACKLOG.md`](../../development/BACKLOG.md).
> Frozen BLG register: [`docs/planning/history/BACKLOG-BLG.md`](../history/BACKLOG-BLG.md).
> Original future-work table (kept for provenance): [FUTURE-WORK.md](FUTURE-WORK.md).

> **Everything ruled out of [D6](../sprints/d6-d9/SPRINT-D6.md), [D7](../sprints/d6-d9/SPRINT-D7.md) and [D8](../sprints/d6-d9/SPRINT-D8.md), plus the files that do not exist yet.**
> Same format as the sprint documents. Every row names the files it touches and the lines it changes, so nothing has to be re-discovered.

## 1 · Where the planning corpus moved

The `2026-08-23` reorganisation moved every planning document. Links here point at the new paths; anything still citing `docs/notes/…` or `docs/sprints/…` is stale — **both directories are now empty**.

## 2 · Files that do not exist yet

Verified absent on `dev-anuj` @ `ac4dfb1`. Every sprint row that names one is creating it, not editing it.

### Domain and service modules

| File                                          | Created by                    | Purpose                                                       |

### Components — the 14 still to build

Thirteen of the shared set already exist, from D3 and D5: `Button`, `Sheet`, `Input`, `SegmentedControl`, plus the nine primitives `Checkbox`, `EmptyState`, `ErrorScreen`, `FieldError`, `PersonRow`, `Pill`, `ProgressRing`, `StatTile`, `Switch`. (`Accordion`, `AlertMessage`, `Toast` and `Tree` also exist but are pre-D3 and are folded into, not counted in, the set.) These fourteen do not exist:

| File                               | Group                              | Retires                                      |

| `src/components/ConfirmSheet.tsx`  | D7 g3 MF-10                        | four browser `confirm()` dialogs             |
| `src/components/Popover.tsx`       | D7 g3 MF-11                        | three in-flow popovers                       |
| `src/components/Skeleton.tsx`      | D7 g3 CS-35                        | —                                            |

**Binding rule from D7:** register each primitive in `.design-sync` **in the commit that creates it**, and consume it at one real call site in the same change. Tailwind compiles from `src/` only — a preview using a class no source file uses renders unstyled.

### Rules blocks

| Path                                    | Created by                                                       | State                             |

> Rules do **not** cascade into subcollections. Each nested path needs its own `match` block at the full path. This is the exact trap that silently broke Round Robin drafts for months.

### Cloud Functions

| Function                    | File                               | Created by                                                                                              |

| `onParticipantReactivated`  | `functions/participantWorkflow.js` | [D6 C16](../sprints/d6-d9/SPRINT-D6.md) — the placer is `onDocumentCreated` at `:91`, so a re-add never fires it |
| unmapped-court notification | `functions/notifications.js`       | D6 F2 — **not implemented anywhere**                                                                    |

## 3 · UI elements not yet built

Each names its call site. None of these exist today.

## 4 · Deferred, with the design recorded

Not scheduled. Each has enough written down to start without re-deciding.

### 4.1 Privacy Policy and Terms of Service — [BLG0067](../history/BACKLOG-BLG.md)

**Files** · `src/pages/StaticPages.tsx:213-311` (Terms, 9 sections) · `:313-364` (Privacy, 5 sections). Routes at `App.tsx:39-40, 170-171`.

Deferred by owner ruling 2026-08-29. Under "the member pays the provider directly", Terms need a provider-relationship section, a points-and-rewards section, a corrected §2 (`StaticPages.tsx:226-232` calls this a "non-profit platform" and never mentions money), and an effective date. Privacy needs **EXIF GPS on court photos** (`courts` stores `exif_gps_lat`, `exif_gps_lng`, `exif_camera`, `exif_taken_at` — undisclosed), the contact-sharing model, photos, WhatsApp, named processors, retention, PIPEDA rights, a named contact, and breach notification.

**Blocked on two facts:** the accountable privacy contact, and the legal entity name.
**Lawyer review before publication:** the liability waiver (`StaticPages.tsx:268-284`), the minors clause (`StaticPages.tsx:235-241`), the provider section.

### 4.2 Provider contact through a booking connection

Recorded in [D6 C12](../sprints/d6-d9/SPRINT-D6.md). Booking creates a connection keyed on `services.provider_id` → `providers/{providerId}`; the contact button and booking number appear once the member books or the provider accepts. Same shape as the opponent `connections/{a__b}` mechanism.

**While deferred:** `contact_phone` and `contact_email` sit on the world-readable `services` document, so they are readable by anyone querying the collection directly. Closing that is a one-line change to `scripts/build-sample-dataset.mjs` plus the shape reference, whenever the connection work lands.

### 4.3 The lesson add-on and coaching pool

Documented by [D8 S5](../sprints/d6-d9/SPRINT-D8.md), **not built**. Full sketch in [DATA_SHAPE.md §9](../../architecture/DATA_SHAPE.md). Storage would follow D6 F1's precedent — a `lesson_pool/{eventId}/members/{uid}` subcollection, because batching four players across an event is **not** derivable from a participant row.

**Five questions still unanswered:** what separates the $20/hr and $15/hr tiers; the "free 15/hr" contradiction; where the pool lives; how the add-on fee reaches `services` and `bookings`; whether "games" hold state. [BLG0061](../history/BACKLOG-BLG.md) is the formal row.

### 4.4 Reseeding a generated draw

Forbidden by D8 decision 4. Seeds freeze at generation; a later entrant takes an open slot and renumbers nobody.

### 4.5 Backup and restore before a live migration

[BLG0023](../history/BACKLOG-BLG.md). Not a D6 blocker under emulator-first — C3 and C4 run against a disposable database. It becomes blocking the moment those migrations are pointed at `toronto-tennis-league`. The only real restore point today is `analysis/snapshots/2026-08-17T01-21-49-655Z/` (3,243 documents), and it ages.
