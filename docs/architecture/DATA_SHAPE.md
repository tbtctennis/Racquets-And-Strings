| **Scope**     | The field-level target shape for every surviving collection, the old→new delta that produces it, and the two tiers of test data that conform to it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Authority** | Product rulings live in [`DECISIONS_BRIEF.md`](../planning/history/planning-2026-08-23/notes/DECISIONS_BRIEF.md) (PD) and [`HARMONIZATION_REPORT.md`](../planning/history/planning-2026-08-23/notes/HARMONIZATION_REPORT.md) (D/L/N/S/R). Later D6–D8 rulings in [`DECISIONS-2026-08-29.md`](../planning/decisions/DECISIONS-2026-08-29.md) and the D6/D7/D8 sprint docs override those where they collide. The delta spine is [`WORKFLOW-STATES.md`](../planning/history/planning-2026-08-23/notes/WORKFLOW-STATES.md) section 0. This file says what the documents look like once those rulings land; it does not make product decisions of its own. |

## 1. Two environments, one shape

`toronto-tennis-league` is the **live deployed project**. `racquets-and-strings` is the **test
environment**. The snapshot under `analysis/snapshots/` is real production data from the live
project in the **old** shape — 3,243 documents, taken 2026-08-17.

Nothing in this repository writes to either project. The pipeline below reads that snapshot from
disk and produces local test data.

## 2. Two tiers of test data

| Tier          | Where                                 | Size            | For                                                                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Canonical** | `tests/fixtures/local-fixtures.mjs`   | 75 documents    | Rules tests, browser tests, one document per lifecycle state               |
| **Volume**    | `tests/fixtures/dataset/` (generated) | 3,233 documents | Driving the UI — real brackets, rosters, leaderboards, notification counts |

The two tiers are not interchangeable. **The volume tier contains no disputed result** — production
has none, because the auto-apply amendment has not shipped. States that do not exist in live data
exist only in the canonical tier: the dispute flag, the bookings lifecycle, the stored partner pool,
the guest partner, a withdrawal with a recorded reason, and the modelled payments rows. Use the canonical tier to test those
screens and the volume tier to test everything at scale.

Both are checked against the same declaration, `tests/fixtures/shape-reference.mjs`, which carries
one **uniform** document per collection with every field populated. `tests/unit/fixtureShape.test.mjs`
enforces the canonical tier; `scripts/build-sample-dataset.mjs` enforces the volume tier as it
builds. A field renamed in one place and not the other fails the unit suite.

```bash
npm run dataset:build
```

```bash
npm run seed:dataset
```

`dataset:build` transforms the newest snapshot into `tests/fixtures/dataset/` and prints a full
transformation report. `seed:dataset` loads it into the local emulator and creates an Auth account
for every member, all sharing the password `local-dataset-123!`, so the UI can be signed in as
anyone. Both refuse to touch a non-local project.

```bash
npm run dataset:xlsx
```

`dataset:xlsx` writes the same dataset to `analysis/exports/new_database/` as one Excel workbook per
collection, for reading the converted database without a Firestore client. Each workbook carries a
`data` sheet (documents, columns in schema order, nested values as JSON text, timestamps as ISO 8601)
and a `schema` sheet (per field: how many documents carry it, how populated it is, a sample value,
and whether the shape reference declares it). `_INDEX.xlsx` lists every collection and records the
provenance — source snapshot, source project, and whether names were pseudonymised.

### Pseudonymisation

**On by default.** Member names, emails, phone numbers and avatars are replaced with deterministic
synthetic values — the same uid always yields the same persona, so `users`, `stats`, `matches`,
`notifications` and `connections` all keep agreeing about who is who. Everything that is _not_
personal survives exactly: event titles, court names, score lines, bracket structure, zone
distribution, timestamps, document ids.

A per-field pass is not sufficient on its own. Some live members have no display name — their email
address _is_ their display name — so it ends up inside notification titles and bodies as free text.
A second pass rewrites known member names, then any surviving email address, then any surviving
phone number, across every string in the output. Verified: zero real-domain addresses and zero
non-555 phone numbers remain.

Generated personas are **unique by construction**. Thirty first names by twenty-six last names is 780
combinations for ~200 members, so by the birthday bound roughly two dozen pairs collide. Two members
sharing a generated name would also share a generated email, and Firebase Auth rejects the second —
seeding dies partway through with `auth/email-already-exists`. Colliding names take a middle initial
(`Kavya J. Xu`), and the email follows. Verified: 194 unique names, 193 unique emails, zero duplicates.

`--real-names` keeps the live values. The output is then **real member data**: `tests/fixtures/dataset/`
is gitignored for exactly this reason, and that output must not be seeded anywhere public.

### Verified

Built and seeded end to end against a local emulator on 2026-08-28: 3,233 documents, 194 Auth
accounts, 172 Firestore Timestamps rehydrated, subcollections (`rr_drafts`, `ranking_history/entries`)
intact, `events/ladder` remapped, 32 walkovers preserved.

## 3. Collections in the new shape

The shape is an open map: adding a collection is adding a key to `SHAPE_REFERENCE`. After D6/D7
the contract covers the original remodel plus the stored partner pool and a modelled `payments`
collection (D9 writes it; this sprint only declares the document). Four collections still retire
outright.

| `events/{eventId}`                              | `organizer_ids`, `zones`, deadlines keyed by draw and round, lesson block                                           |
| `events/{eventId}/rr_drafts/{drawKey}`          | The `withdrawn` array retires                                                                                       |

| `event_participants/{id}`                       | One `status` replaces the removal flag and the RR withdrawn list                                                    |
| `partner_pool/{eventId}/members/{uid}`          | **New** (D6 F1) — stored doubles pool membership                                                                    |

## 4. The delta, collection by collection

Counts are documents affected in the live snapshot, from the transform's own report.

### 4.1 `users` — 194 documents

| Field                                                                                                          | Change | Ruling                                                           | Live |

### 4.2 `stats` — 204 documents

| Field                            | Change   | Ruling                                                                                                                                                             | Live |
| -------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---: |
| `loses`                          | drop     | D6 C4 — stored, displayed on no screen; both writers stop                                                                                                          |  187 |
| `pointswon`, `totalPointsPlayed` | **keep** | D6 C2 restores them (overrides L14). Written on played tournament results, never on walkovers                                                                      |  188 |
| `tournamentsPlayed`              | **keep** | D6 C3 — counts distinct tournament events joined, incremented in `onParticipantCreated`, never on a result. Snapshot values equalled loss count and are recomputed |  187 |
| `rankPosition`                   | **keep** | D8-RNK / D6 — DC-11's "rendered nowhere" was wrong; `rankSnapshot` writes it, three screens read it                                                                |   97 |
| `location`                       | **add**  | D6 C20 — city derived from `preferences.preferred_courts`; server-only                                                                                             |    — |
| `rrPointsBackfilledAt`           | drop     | One-off migration stamp                                                                                                                                            |   12 |

`rankTrend`, `rankMove` and `rankUpdatedAt` stay with `rankPosition`. `loses` stays retired.

### 4.3 `preferences` — 204 documents

| Field                                                   | Change  | Ruling                                              | Live |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---: |
| `event_creator`                                         | drop    | PD6 · S6 — ends at the `providers` cutover          |  204 |
| `stringer`, `stringer_id`, `coach`, `coach_id`          | move    | R7 — to `providers`                                 |    3 |
| `availability`, `availability_day`, `availability_time` | drop    | Superseded by `availability_tags`                   |  204 |
| `preferred_zone_manual`                                 | **add** | L5 — stops a court edit silently re-zoning a member |    — |
| `available_to_play`                                     | **add** | L16 — off shows an Away pill                        |    — |

Read access becomes public (L9 · PD1 · R7) once the role fields are gone.

### 4.4 `providers` — new, 4 rows derived

Derived from the three live `preferences` role flags plus the provider ids on the catalog rows:
`karan` and `fortyforty` (stringer), `archie` (coach), and one more from the offer rows. Roles only —
event authority stays on `events.organizer_ids` (L4). Issued and re-issued by an Admin-SDK script,
never in-app (PD5).

### 4.5 `services` and `awards` — the `tasks` split

`tasks` is three collections wearing one name. The transform splits it:

| Live `tasks` rows | Becomes    | Ruling |               Count |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ------ | ------------------: |
| `type: 'offer'`   | `services` | N1     |                   9 |
| `award_name` set  | `awards`   | PD10   | 34 rows → 11 awards |
| everything else   | `tasks`    | —      |                 153 |

Award rows collapse: `tasks/{awardId}_{uid}` becomes one `awards/{awardId}` carrying a `winners`
array, which is what PD10 asks for. `tasks` keeps progress documents only, and stays publicly
readable (PD1).

Rows with `type: 'group'` have no home in the new shape and are dropped, not migrated.

### 4.6 `matches` — 399 documents, the largest delta

| Field                                                              | Change  | Ruling                                                           | Live |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---: |
| `player_1_contact`, `player_2_contact`                             | drop    | Contacts resolve at display time from `contacts`                 |  272 |
| `rr_group_bonus_v2`                                                | rename  | N2 → `rr_groupbonus`                                             |   58 |
| `schedule_requested`                                               | drop    | S5 — the boolean never recorded who asked; no backfill           |   27 |
| `no_show`                                                          | drop    | D6 · L10 — walkovers only                                        |    8 |
| `proposed_date`, `proposed_slot`, `proposed_by`, `schedule_status` | drop    | WDR 3 — no dates or times are stored                             |    5 |
| `claimed_winner_uid`, `claimed_winner_name`, `score_line`          | drop    | Sprint D5 strip                                                  |    5 |
| `result_at`                                                        | **add** | L2 — re-stamped on every apply                                   |  163 |
| `result_submissions`                                               | **add** | Amendment 2026-08-23 — map keyed by submitter uid                |    3 |
| `score_disputed`, `score_disputed_at`                              | **add** | Amendment — set only when two submissions name different winners |    — |
| `score_pending`                                                    | never   | Retired before it shipped                                        |    0 |
| `result_application`                                               | drop    | D6 C10 — applied flag lives inside `result_submissions`          |    — |
| `points_winner`, `points_loser`                                    | **add** | D7 G6 — league points actually paid; the group table reads them  |    — |

`completed_at` pins at first scoring and is never rewritten (D3); `result_at` moves with every
apply (L2). The transform back-fills `result_at` from `completed_at` wherever a result already
exists, and reconstructs `result_submissions` from the retired `claimed_winner_*` pair on the three
matches a player actually reported.

**The four `no_show` rows.** All four are unscored RR fixtures — all-zero scores, no winner,
`walkover: false`. A walkover requires a winner (D6), so they are not walkovers. They revert to
plain pending matches with the flag dropped. See open question 10.

### 4.7 `event_participants` — 297 documents

| Field                    | Change  | Ruling                                      | Live |
| ------------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---: |
| `removal`, `removal_at`  | replace | L12 — one `status`: `active` \| `withdrawn` |    1 |
| `zone_change_requested`  | drop    | L15 — legacy twin of `req_zone_change`      |   10 |
| `status` + `withdrawn_*` | **add** | L12 — reason, note, at, by                  |    — |
| `zone`                   | **add** | L15 — per-event, organizer-set              |    — |

`req_zone_change` and `new_zone` are **kept** by owner ruling (L15): after generation the player
sits in both zone draws until the organizer resolves it, and a zone change never unseats.

The migrated withdrawal carries `withdrawn_reason: 'other'` and a note saying so — the retired
`removal` flag never recorded a reason, so inventing one would be fabrication.

### 4.8 `rr_drafts` — 4 documents

The live draft carries a `withdrawn` array. **That array is the RR withdrawn list L12 replaces.**
Keeping both is how a re-seated withdrawal used to survive a reload — the matches change reached
`onSnapshot` before the list update, and the just-removed player was re-seated. The transform drops
it; `event_participants.status` is the single source.

### 4.9 `bookings` — new, no live source

The bookings lifecycle does not exist in the deployed project. The transform **synthesises** five,
one per L11 state: `lead`, `in_progress`, `in_progress` carrying `marked_completed_at`,
`completed`, `cancelled`. The stamp is deliberately its own fixture — it is a stamp, not a fourth
status, and that distinction is easy to lose. D6 C6 renamed it from `completion_requested_at`.

### 4.10 `offers` and `redemptions`

`offers/{uid}` keeps only spend, under its existing name `pointsSpent`; `lastEarnedSnapshot` dropped.
Balances and totals derive at read (L9 · PD1).

`redemptions` renames `stringer_id` → `provider_id` and `stringer_name` → `provider_name` — the
field always held the provider id for both categories. The `flagged` and `cancel_requested` review
states retire with `redemption_locks` (L11); any live coupon in one lands on `active` and is
reported.

### 4.11 `partner_pool` — stored (D6 F1)

Open question 4 is closed. The doubles partner pool is **stored**, not derived from participant
rows. Two subcollections under the event, document id = uid:

| Path                                    | Fields                                                                                                                               | Who writes                           |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `partner_pool/{eventId}/members/{uid}`  | `uid`, `name`, `category` (`mens`\|`womens`\|`mixed`), `skill`, `created_at`                                                         | The joining member; no client update |
| `partner_pool/{eventId}/contacts/{uid}` | Projection of `contacts`: `email`, `phone`, `whatsapp_contact`, `preferred_mode_of_contact`, `whatsapp_same_as_phone`, `contactable` | Server on join; deleted on leave     |

A Doubles join with a blank partner writes the membership row. The volume transform derives those
rows from Doubles participants who have neither `partner_uid` nor `partner_name`. A guest partner
(name, no uid) is **not** in the pool.

### 4.12 `payments` — modelled for D9, no live source

Headroom for collections that are coming, payments first. This is **not** a new database — one
collection on the existing Firestore, declared here so D9 has a contract. Server-only writes. No
card data. Stripe identifiers are the ones needed to refund.

| Field                                                                           | Meaning                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `uid`, `user_name`                                                              | The member                                                                     |
| `type`                                                                          | `donation` now; `court booking` when Book My Court arrives                     |
| `amount`, `currency`                                                            | Major-unit amount (`cad`)                                                      |
| `season`                                                                        | `summer` (May–November) or `winter` (December–April)                           |
| `state`                                                                         | `succeeded` or `refunded`. Cancel and refund are one event                     |
| `stripe_checkout_session_id`, `stripe_payment_intent_id`, `stripe_refund_id`    | Refund handles. `stripe_refund_id` is set only when `state` is `refunded`      |
| `cancellation_requested_at`, `cancellation_requested_by`, `cancellation_status` | The request (`requested` / `approved` / `declined`); it is not itself a refund |
| `refunded_at`, `refunded_by`                                                    | Set with `state` `refunded` and `stripe_refund_id`                             |

The transform synthesises four rows — a donation, a cancellation request, a refund, and a court-booking
row — the same way it synthesises bookings. D9 Functions are what make a payment real. The Contributor
Badge follows the refund (`state` `refunded` with `stripe_refund_id`), not a pending request.

## 5. Findings this work produced

Things the transform surfaced that are not recorded in any decision document.

1. **`services` has no rules block.** `DATA_MODEL.md` lists it and `src/features/services/types.ts`
   defines its `Reward` interface, but `firestore.rules` contains zero occurrences of `services`, so
   it falls through to deny. Seeded service documents are unreadable by the client until a block
   lands. This blocks the Services UI on the new shape.
2. **`rr_drafts.withdrawn` is an unrecorded second withdrawn list.** L12 names the `removal` flag and
   "the RR withdrawn list"; this is that list, and no document names the field.
3. **`site_stats` carries both `updatedAt` and `updated_at`** on different documents — a one-name-per-thing
   breach the ledger does not cover.
4. **15 `event_participants` point at events that are not in the snapshot.** Real orphans in live
   data. The transform keeps them and reports them: the UI ships against production, so it should
   survive them, but they are worth a look.
5. **160 values are Firestore `Timestamp`s, not ISO strings** — on `users.lastActive`,
   `events.start_date`/`end_date`/`join_last_date`, and `event_participants.created_at`. The same
   logical field is an ISO string on other documents. The seeder rehydrates them; any code reading
   these fields must handle both.
6. **One live member has no display name** — their email address is their display name, so it reached
   notification bodies as free text. This is why pseudonymisation needs the free-text pass.

## 6. Open questions

These need an owner ruling. Each one is currently resolved the way the note says, and each is a
one-line change if the answer differs.

## 7. The legacy island

Six documents in `local-fixtures.mjs` are scheduled for deletion by shipped rulings and survive only
because live code still reads them. They are quarantined in `LEGACY_COMPAT_FIXTURES`, and a unit test
asserts the list does not grow silently.

| Document                                | Retires under | Breaks today if removed                                                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `preferences/organizer-a.event_creator` | PD6 · S6      | `isGlobalEventCreator()` in the rules — the e2e organizer-creates-event test     |
| `preferences/multi-role-a` role flags   | R7 · PD6      | Same                                                                             |
| `group_lessons/{month}`                 | L8 · PD2      | The e2e group-lesson coach-contact test, and the contacts rule's coach predicate |
| `group_lesson_contact_access/current`   | L8 · PD2      | Same                                                                             |
| `tasks/synthetic-offer`                 | N1            | The marketplace reads the catalog from `tasks`, not yet from `services`          |
| `tasks/synthetic-coaching-offer`        | N1            | Same                                                                             |

When the `providers` cutover and the `services` migration land, deleting that array is the whole
change.

## 8. Walkover — one name (owner ruling, 2026-08-28)

Finding **F-A** recorded two names for one thing: the match document stores `walkover`, while the
score submission carried `is_walkover`. `DECISIONS_BRIEF` section 1 asserted it was not stored at all.

**Ruling: `walkover` is the one name. `is_walkover` is renamed to it, not deleted.** The rule is
symmetric — whichever name is kept, the other conforms to it; here the stored field wins because it
is the one the server, the rules and the UI already read.

What this touched:

| Site                                                | Change                                               |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/features/tournament/domain/scoreSubmission.ts` | `ScoreIntent.isWalkover` → `walkover`, and its local |
| `src/pages/tournament/useTournament.ts`             | Parameter and call site                              |
| `tests/unit/scoreSubmission.test.mjs`               | Assertion                                            |
| `tests/rules/firestore.matrix.test.mjs`             | Payload field `is_walkover` → `walkover`             |
| `tests/integration/functions.emulator.test.mjs`     | Payload field `is_walkover` → `walkover`             |

Two things deliberately **not** changed:

- **`src/pages/tournament/ScoreModal.tsx`** keeps a local `isWalkover`. It is derived from a prop
  that is _already_ called `walkover` (`const isWalkover = !!walkover?.checked`), so taking the name
  would shadow the prop. This is a UI-local boolean, not the data field — the one-name rule is
  satisfied at the data layer.
- **Nothing on the server ever read `is_walkover`.** `functions/` contains zero occurrences; the two
  test payloads were sending a field no consumer looked at. Renaming them keeps the payload shape
  honest rather than leaving dead keys behind.

`walkover` stays a stored boolean rather than being derived from all-zero-plus-winner. Derivation
would be ambiguous against the four ex-`no_show` rows, which are all-zero with **no** winner.

## 9. Lesson add-on — product sketch, not scheduled

**Owner direction, 2026-08-28: no changes now, plan for later.** Recorded here so the intent is not
lost. Nothing below is built, and nothing reads the placeholder block in the shape reference.

The shape of the idea:

- A member **signing up for a social** is offered add-on options at sign-up.
- The options are **group classes**, **games**, and **coaching**.
- Choosing coaching puts the member into a **pool of players**.
- The pool is batched into **groups of four**, and coaches pick up a batch to deliver a group lesson.
- Pricing mentioned: **$20/hr** and **$15/hr**.
- The lesson is an **add-on fee on the event**, not a separate purchase.

Undecided, and needed before any schema is written:

1. **What separates the $20/hr and $15/hr tiers?** Group size, coach seniority, and a member discount
   are all consistent with what was said.
2. **"free 15$/hr classes"** — as dictated this is contradictory. Either the social itself is free and
   the class costs $15/hr, or there is a genuinely free tier alongside a paid one.
3. **Where does the pool live?** Batching four players across a whole event is not derivable from a
   participant row. The doubles partner pool (4.11) set the precedent — a
   `lesson_pool/{eventId}/members/{uid}` subcollection, documented by D8 S5, not built.
4. **How does the add-on fee reach the points and payments model?** `services` and `bookings` already
   describe a paid provider engagement; a lesson may belong there rather than on the event.
5. **Are "games" an add-on with its own state, or just a social format?**

Until these are answered, `group_lessons` stays retired and `events.lesson` stays an unratified
placeholder. The D8 S5 coaching-pool target — three actions, typed bookings, pooling on any
event — is appended in section 10. That section documents the target; it does not build it.

## 10. Coaching pool — documented target (D8 S5)

Owner ruling 2026-08-31, recorded here so the live architecture matches
[`COACHING_POOL.md`](COACHING_POOL.md). **Not built.** Section 9 above is unchanged.

A coaching service offers three actions: **Book group lesson**, **Book**, and **Redeem
discount**. Pooling is **not limited to socials** — it applies to any event that offers coaching.
Bookings and offers gain a **type**: group classes, private classes, stringing, with room for
more.

**The old `group_lessons` collection is never revived** (owner ruling 2026-08-31; D6 C8 /
TASK-511 deleted it). "Book group lesson" is an action on a coaching service. A group lesson is
a booking of **type** group classes. Nothing reads or writes the retired collection again.

Storage, when built, is `lesson_pool/{eventId}/members/{uid}` — the D6 F1 partner-pool
precedent — because batching four players across an event is not derivable from a participant
row. The five unanswered questions in section 9 still block a ratified schema. Current
checkout behaviour (two Marketplace buttons, no type, no pool) is the current-state half of
[`COACHING_POOL.md`](COACHING_POOL.md).
