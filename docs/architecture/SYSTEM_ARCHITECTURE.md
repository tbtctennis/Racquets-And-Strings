# System architecture

## Current state

The application is a Vite-built React web client hosted by Firebase Hosting. The browser uses Firebase Auth for identity, Firestore for application data, Storage for images, and regional Cloud Functions for server-authoritative workflows. The client also initializes GA4 Analytics when the browser supports it. Functions use Resend for email and have scheduled integrations with Google Sheets and BigQuery for operational metrics.

This checkout is branch `spiderman` (SHA `dc111f22`). **Location is a data field on `stats/{uid}`**, not a second Firebase project. Toronto is the only mapped city. Rally is the runtime name for casual play; `friendly` is retired in source.

Diagrams: [current system architecture](diagrams/current-system-architecture.md), [location scoping](diagrams/location-scoping.md), [play loops](diagrams/play-loops.md).

The current Functions region is `us-central1`; scheduled functions format dates in `America/Toronto`. Firebase configuration is supplied through `VITE_FIREBASE_*` environment variables, while `.firebaserc` contains only a non-default `local -> rands-local` alias. Production must be selected explicitly through an approval-gated workflow.

## Target state

Preserve the same product topology while adding explicit environment selection, local emulator
configuration, rules tests, CI gates, and a staging project. Privileged data mutations should
converge on Functions or server-controlled workflows; the browser should remain an untrusted
caller even when UI role state says Organizer or Admin. The local rules suites now run through
temporary emulator configurations; this proves the checked-in rules contract, not deployed state.

## Evidence

- `src/lib/firebase.ts` — browser SDK initialization, env vars, Analytics, and Functions region.
- `src/App.tsx` and `src/main.tsx` — SPA routes, private route guard, lazy loading, and error boundary.
- `firebase.json`, `.firebaserc` — Hosting, Functions, rules, and active-project default.
- `functions/lib/constants.js`, `functions/lib/notify.js` — region, timezone, email, and notification boundaries.
- `functions/index.js` — trigger and callable surface, including `location.js`, `partnerPool.js`, `rallyPoints.js`, `competitionResults.js`, `tournamentResults.js`, `participantWorkflow.js`, `withdrawalWorkflow.js`, `zoneMoves.js`.
- `functions/notifications.js`, `functions/rewards.js`, `functions/adminMetrics.js` — notifications, rewards, metrics.

## Risks and open questions

- `.firebaserc` carries only the local `rands-local` alias. Staging and production remain external approvals because this checkout does not ship an authorized non-local deployment target.
- `hosting:preview` and `hosting:deploy` are wrapper-gated, require an explicit `FIREBASE_DEPLOY_PROJECT_ID`, and pass `--project` directly. They do not inherit a default CLI project from this repository.
- Google Sheets, BigQuery, Resend, and image moderation require credentials/configuration not present in this checkout.
- Local emulator coverage includes Firestore and Storage Rules, callable/trigger integration,
  synthetic fixtures, and focused Hosting-backed browser journeys. Equivalent staging behavior
  remains unverified until an authorized non-production Firebase project is provided.
