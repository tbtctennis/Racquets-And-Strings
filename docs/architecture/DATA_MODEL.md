# Data model

## Current state

Firestore is a document model with several consolidated collections. The client and Functions use a shared `matches` collection distinguished by `category`, a shared `courts` collection distinguished by `type`, and a shared `tasks` collection containing progress, group-award, offer, and claim-related records. Tournament Round Robin drafts are nested under events.

## Key relationships

- `users`, `stats`, `preferences`, and `contacts` share the Firebase Auth UID as document ID.
- `event_participants.event_id` points to `events/{eventId}`; `matches.event_id` points to an event for tournament fixtures.
- `matches.player_1_uid` and `player_2_uid` identify opponents; accepted rallies/challenges and tournament fixtures create `connections/{sortedUid__sortedUid}`. Rally documents have no `event_id`.
- `stats.location` is derived by `onPreferredCourtsChanged` from `preferences.preferred_courts` via `functions/courts.json`. Clients cannot write it. Unset means the member has no mapped city yet.
- `partner_pool/{eventId}/members/{uid}` is the client membership row; `contacts/{uid}` under the same event is the Functions projection used by the doubles panel.
- `events/{eventId}/rr_drafts/{drawKey}` is the draft source for draw generation; generated fixtures land in `matches`.
- `tasks/{uid}` is the user progress projection; Functions write award ledger records with deterministic IDs under `tasks`.
- `providers/{providerId}.roles` identifies provider capability; event-specific organizer authority
  remains on `events.organizer_ids`. `member_uid` is an optional link used for provider queue
  ownership, never a client-writable role flag.
- `services/{serviceId}` is the catalog source. Existing `tasks` documents with `type: offer` are a
  read-only compatibility fallback until an authorized migration; `offers/{uid}` remains only the
  server-owned points-spent projection.
- Booking completion uses `marked_completed_at` as a timestamp while the player answers; it is
  not a fourth status. Bookings have no `type`. `group_lessons` is retired (TASK-511); a later
  group lesson is a booking of type group classes, not a revival of that collection. The
  coaching-pool target (`lesson_pool/{eventId}/members/{uid}`, three service actions) is
  documented in [COACHING_POOL.md](COACHING_POOL.md) and [DATA_SHAPE.md](DATA_SHAPE.md) §10 and
  is not built.
- Storage paths under `avatars/{uid}`, `listings/{uid}`, `court_reports/{uid}`, and `court_suggestions/{uid}` are referenced by Firestore documents.

## Target state

Keep stable document IDs and append-only activity records while continuing to formalize field schemas and ownership in rules tests and typed contracts. Treat `stats`, reward ledgers, connection markers, public-contact markers, notifications, aggregate collections, and tournament outcomes as server-authoritative.

### Sprint D4 remodel review

The event roster now carries the event-scoped `zone`, optional doubles partner shape, and
`status: active|withdrawn` with withdrawal metadata. A withdrawal remains registered and
unplaced; the server callable records walkovers for unplayed fixtures and leaves completed
results unchanged. Participant creation is the only automatic seating trigger, and knockout
first-round seats remain `PLAYER_LOADING` until an organizer assigns them. `preferences` owns the
member's `preferred_zone_manual` and `available_to_play` flags, while `events` may persist both
`zone_draw_config` and the derived `zones` coverage. Round deadlines are keyed by draw and round,
excluding the Round Robin group stage.

The Rules boundary now uses explicit participant and preference field whitelists. Profile identity
does not carry `profile_details_visible`; league display is public. Validation for this remodel is
local-only. Production deployment and data mutation remain out of scope, and staging is deferred
until an authorized isolated project and verified recovery path exist.

## Evidence, risks, and open questions

- Evidence: `firestore.rules`, `storage.rules`, `src/features/**`, `src/pages/tournament/useTournament.ts`, `functions/**`.
- Public reads remain deliberate for profile identity, events, rankings, listings, the services catalog, and aggregate site data. Field classification and projection ownership are the [public-field sensitivity contract](PUBLIC_FIELD_SENSITIVITY.md). Consented preference discovery is the event-scoped projection in [PREFERENCE_PROJECTION.md](../domain/PREFERENCE_PROJECTION.md). `preferences` is world-readable; `public_preferences` is deny-all. Operational metrics stay on `admin_stats`. The retired `group_lessons` collection is not on the active Rules surface.
- Client-writable sensitive documents now have Rules-level type, length, and immutable-field checks. Nested event maps and tournament match payloads remain application-validated.
- The deployed schema and historical migration state were not available for this local audit; do not infer production document shape from one code path.

### Sprint D5 component and service review

The component primitives now have typed, accessible contracts for people, stat tiles, pills,
fields, empty/error states, switches, checkboxes, and progress rings. Providers, services, and
bookings have callable-owned lifecycle boundaries; provider checks use `providers/{id}.member_uid`
only. Leftover preference stringer/coach flags are compatibility residue, not a grant. Task
claims route volunteer/host review to the event manager and ambassador claims auto-approve. The
retired monthly group-lesson collection and callables are no longer part of the client or Rules
surface. Validation is local-only; no production deployment or data mutation was performed, and
staging remains deferred until an authorized isolated project and verified recovery path exist.

### Sprint D6 preparation: naming and the shape contract

**Walkover field name.** On `matches`, the walkover flag is `walkover`. The client intent object
that produces it now carries the same name, so the field reads identically in the form, the domain
rule, the callable, the document, and every reader. `is_walkover` is retired and recorded as such;
it is not accepted as an alias on write. No stored data changed — the live documents already used
`walkover`, and this closed a client-side fork in the name.

**The shape contract.** `tests/fixtures/shape-reference.mjs` is now the machine-readable declaration
of the intended document shape: one field-by-field reference document per collection (an open map,
so later collections such as `payments` slot in without a new database), plus
registries of retired fields and retired collections and the canonical task-tier and zone lists.
`tests/unit/fixtureShape.test.mjs` enforces it, so a field cannot be added, removed, or renamed in
the fixtures without the declaration being updated in the same change. The narrative version, with
the old-to-new deltas and the open questions, is [DATA_SHAPE.md](DATA_SHAPE.md). Where this table
and the shape reference disagree, the shape reference is the one under test.

**Test data.** `scripts/build-sample-dataset.mjs` transforms a live snapshot into the new shape as
3,233 pseudonymised documents: stable synthetic personas per UID, with a free-text scrub pass
because at least one live display name is itself an email address. `tests/fixtures/seed-dataset.mjs`
loads it and refuses to run against any project other than `rands-local` or any non-loopback
emulator host. This is a local fixture, not a staging dataset, and it is not a substitute for the
unresolved question of what the deployed documents actually contain.

Validation is local-only. No production deployment or data mutation was performed.

### Sprint D6 on `spiderman`: location, rally, partner pool

**Location.** `stats.location` is live in Functions and Rules helpers and is on the uniform `stats` document in `tests/fixtures/shape-reference.mjs`. `events.location` remains a court-name string (shape reference: `Ramsden Park`) and must not be confused with the city field.

**Rally.** Runtime `category` is `rally`. `friendly` is retired in `src/`, `functions/`, and tests. Historical documents may still carry the old word until a storage migration; readers should not treat `friendly` as a write path.

**Partner pool.** `partner_pool/{eventId}/members/{uid}` and `.../contacts/{uid}` are on the shape-reference uniform map. Membership is stored, not derived from the participant row.

**Join courts.** `event_participants` carry the preferred court chosen at join; zone is derived; Unplaced is explicit.

**Payments.** `payments/{paymentId}` is modelled on the shape contract for D9 (donations now, court-booking rows later). It is not a new database. Live Functions do not write it yet.
