# Local development and verification

This guide takes a new engineer from a clean checkout to a seeded application backed only by
synthetic local Firebase data. None of these commands require staging or production access.

## Install the toolchain

Install Node.js 22, npm, and Java 21. Confirm the active versions before installing dependencies:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
java -version
```

`node --version` must report major version 22. The Firestore emulator requires Java; CI uses
Temurin 21. On Apple Silicon macOS, the launcher also detects Homebrew `openjdk@21` at
`/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@21`.

From a clean checkout of `dev-anuj`, install both dependency sets from their lockfiles:

```bash
npm ci
npm --prefix functions ci
npx playwright install chromium
cp .env.example .env.local
```

On Linux, use `npx playwright install --with-deps chromium` if the host does not already provide
Playwright's system browser dependencies. This browser install is required because `npm run verify`
includes the isolated Chromium smoke suite.

Keep `VITE_USE_FIREBASE_EMULATORS=true` and `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=rands-local` in
`.env.local`. The template contains local placeholders, not deployable credentials. Never add a
service account, Resend key, production Firebase config, or real member data to this file.
`VITE_FIREBASE_APP_CHECK_SITE_KEY` stays blank locally because the emulator bypass is explicit. An
approved staging environment must supply its own reCAPTCHA Enterprise site key and verify App Check
before pre-auth account lookup is considered operational.

## Start and seed the local application

In terminal 1, start Auth, Firestore, Functions, Storage, and Hosting emulators:

```bash
npm run emulators
```

The launcher checks the configured ports before Firebase starts and always passes
`--project rands-local`. When all emulators report ready, seed deterministic local fixtures:

```bash
npm run seed:emulator
```

In terminal 2, start Vite and open `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Use any of these local-only accounts on `/login`:

| Role               | Email                          | Password                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Member             | `member-a@example.invalid`     | `local-member-a-123!`     |
| Event organizer    | `organizer-a@example.invalid`  | `local-organizer-a-123!`  |
| Provider           | `provider-a@example.invalid`   | `local-provider-a-123!`   |
| Multi-role fixture | `multi-role-a@example.invalid` | `local-multi-role-a-123!` |

The source of truth for credentials and seeded documents is
[`tests/fixtures/local-fixtures.mjs`](../../tests/fixtures/local-fixtures.mjs). The seed command
refuses a non-local Auth host or any project other than `rands-local`.

## Resolve occupied emulator ports

The standard ports are recorded in `firebase.json`: UI 4000, Hosting 5000, Functions 5001,
Firestore 8080, Auth 9099, and Storage 9199. The launcher names every conflict before exiting.

Either stop the conflicting local process or create an ignored, developer-specific config:

```bash
cp firebase.json firebase.local.json
# Edit only emulators.<service>.port values in firebase.local.json.
npm run emulators -- --config firebase.local.json
```

`firebase.local.json` is ignored by Git. An alternate config changes local ports only; the launcher
still forces `rands-local` and rejects arbitrary launcher flags. To run the browser application
against those ports, put the matching overrides in `.env.local` before starting Vite:

```dotenv
VITE_USE_FIREBASE_EMULATORS=true
VITE_FIREBASE_EMULATOR_HOST=127.0.0.1
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_EMULATOR_PORT=19099
VITE_FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_PORT=18080
VITE_FUNCTIONS_EMULATOR_PORT=15001
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_EMULATOR_PORT=19199
```

Replace the example values with the ports selected in `firebase.local.json`. The CLI configuration
also controls Hosting and Emulator UI ports; those do not need Vite variables.
Before running the seed command against that full suite, export the Admin SDK emulator hosts using
the same Auth and Firestore ports (these are local endpoints, not credentials):

```bash
export FIREBASE_AUTH_EMULATOR_HOST=127.0.0.1:19099
export FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST=127.0.0.1:18080
npm run seed:emulator
```

Replace the example ports with the values in `firebase.local.json`. The seed command still refuses
any project other than `rands-local` and any non-local Auth host.

Rules tests and fixture smoke tests already allocate isolated temporary ports, so they do not need
the alternate full-suite config.

## Run the local quality gates

Use the smallest command while iterating, then run the aggregate gate before handing off a change:

```bash
npm test                       # root unit tests
npm --prefix functions test    # Functions helper unit tests (typechecks the TS slice first)
npm --prefix functions run build:ts  # compile functions/lib/*.ts to CommonJS .js
npm run test:rules             # Firestore Rules, temporary emulator
npm run test:storage           # Storage Rules, temporary emulator
npm run test:fixtures          # real Auth/Firestore seed boundary, temporary emulators
npm run test:functions:integration # reward, friendly, and tournament Functions emulator paths
npm run test:e2e                  # Hosting, signup/profile, event join, and tournament score journeys
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run format:check           # every tracked working file, except planning history/generated/vendor paths
npm run docs:verify
npm run build
npm run verify                 # every reliable repository-local gate above
```

`test:e2e` starts isolated Auth, Firestore, Functions, and Storage emulator ports, seeds synthetic
accounts/documents, builds the browser bundle against those endpoints, starts the Firebase Hosting
emulator, and runs one-worker Chromium Hosting, signup/profile, event-join, and organizer
score/advancement journeys. It terminates the local processes after success or failure. Critical
reward, friendly, and tournament mutations also remain covered at the callable/trigger boundary by
`test:functions:integration`.

## Find the system contracts

- Start at the [architecture index](../architecture/README.md) for system, data-flow, data-model,
  authorization, and environment boundaries.
- Read [tournament rules](../domain/TOURNAMENT_RULES.md),
  [Round Robin rules](../domain/ROUND_ROBIN_RULES.md), and
  [scoring and points](../domain/SCORING_AND_POINTS.md) before changing match behavior.
- Use [data flow](../architecture/DATA_FLOW.md) and the
  [maintainability map](MAINTAINABILITY.md) to find repositories, domain modules, route
  orchestration, and server-authoritative writes.
- Review [security baseline](SECURITY_BASELINE.md), `firestore.rules`, and `storage.rules` before
  changing a read or write boundary.
- Follow the [migration framework](../../scripts/migrations/README.md). It is dry-run by default,
  requires an explicit project, never makes production implicit, and refuses completion when
  recompute-and-diff finds unexplained drift.

## Know what has and has not been verified

| Level                 | Repository evidence                                                       | Claim boundary                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Local verification    | Unit tests, temporary Rules emulators, fixture smoke, build               | Reproducible from this checkout                   |
| Source-level security | Rules tests, server validation tests, security review                     | Proves checked-in policy, not deployed policy     |
| Staging verification  | No authorized staging project is configured                               | External gate; do not claim it from local results |
| Production deployment | Explicit approval, target, credentials, backup/recovery evidence required | Never run or infer from this guide                |

Do not run bare `firebase deploy`. Hosting wrappers require an explicit target, and Rules,
Functions, Storage promotion, backup recovery, DNS, secrets, and provider configuration remain
separate external approval gates.

### Provider bootstrap (dry-run first)

Provider role rows are server-issued; there is no in-app role elevation path. Validate an input
file locally with:

```text
node scripts/bootstrap-providers.mjs --input /path/to/providers.json
```

Applying requires an explicitly authorized non-production project and confirmation:

```text
node scripts/bootstrap-providers.mjs --input /path/to/providers.json --apply --project STAGING_PROJECT_ID --confirm PROVIDERS
```

The script rejects the production project id and does not run from the normal client workflow.

Existing accounts that still carry `preferences.stringer_id` / `coach_id` are lifted onto
`providers/{id}.member_uid` by the additive, dry-run-first migration:

```text
node scripts/migrations/004-provider-role.mjs --project rands-local --key serviceAccount.json --dry-run
```

Apply is opt-in. Rollback unlinks `member_uid` on migration-written rows; leftover preference
flags are not deleted. Preference flags do not grant provider checks.

## Troubleshooting

- **`java` is missing:** install Java 21, set `JAVA_HOME` if needed, and rerun `java -version`.
- **A port is unavailable:** use the named conflict from the launcher and the alternate local config
  procedure above.
- **The app reaches a non-local Firebase project:** stop immediately. Restore `.env.local` from
  `.env.example` and confirm `VITE_USE_FIREBASE_EMULATORS=true` plus project `rands-local`.
- **Fixture seeding refuses to run:** start the local Auth and Firestore emulators first and remove
  any environment value that points outside localhost.
- **Formatting reports an unexpected file:** add an ignore only when the path is generated or
  vendored. Fix first-party formatting instead of broadening exclusions.
