# Maintainability map

## Dependency map

```text
Route/page
  -> feature hook/controller
    -> pure domain rule or feature service
      -> repository/data access (where a meaningful boundary exists)
        -> Firebase SDK / Cloud Functions
```

Diagram: [client layer map](../architecture/diagrams/client-layer-map.md).

The current application is partway through this shape. The tournament scoring and Round Robin
primitives now live in `src/features/tournament/domain/`; page compatibility exports keep existing
callers stable while further persistence extraction can happen without a rewrite. Signup field
validation is similarly isolated in `src/features/signup/signupForm.ts`. Event registration and
tournament-slot lookup now use `src/features/events/services/eventRepository.ts`, with the document
shape tested independently in `eventParticipant.ts`. Participant counts and joined-registration
mapping live in `eventRegistrationState.ts`; the Events hook subscribes only.
Organizer schedule-request and unplaced-registrant queues are selected in
`src/features/tournament/domain/organizerQueues.ts` from subscription/load helpers in
`tournamentSubscriptions.ts`. The Marketplace catalog is assembled in
`src/features/services/catalog.ts` from `servicesRepository.ts`; `useServicesCatalog` groups the
already-built rows for presentation.
Shared tournament-match and leaderboard row types now live under feature-owned type modules rather
than making data-access code import from a page or hook. Tournament placement, zone normalization,
and skill-band rules are likewise owned by `src/features/tournament/domain/placement.ts`; page
modules retain compatibility exports only. Parsed court records are owned by
`src/features/courts/`, so check-in and photo-report features do not import court types from the
CourtMap page.
Server-authoritative tournament result persistence now crosses
`src/features/tournament/services/tournamentResultService.ts` into the idempotent
`functions/tournamentResults.js` transaction. The page hook constructs intent only; score
validation, auto-approval/reconciliation, and statistics/points/advancement application no longer
depend on client subscriptions or presentation state. Ladder challenge confirmation and Round Robin
group bonuses use the same callable boundary.

## Quality commands

- `npm run typecheck` runs the TypeScript compiler without emitting files.
- The root `tsconfig.json` enables full TypeScript `strict` mode plus no-implicit-return,
  no-fallthrough, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, and `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`. Optional
  properties that callers pass as explicit `undefined` are typed `prop?: T | undefined`.
  Indexed access is narrowed at the use site (guards, defaults) rather than by rewriting
  the data model.
- `npm run lint` runs ESLint over first-party React/TypeScript source, scripts, tests, and Functions.
  Existing warnings for legacy hook dependency choices, explicit `any`, and unused legacy values
  remain visible; new errors fail the command.
- `npm run format:check` enumerates every tracked first-party working file rather than only a diff,
  so an up-to-date branch cannot silently check zero files. Generated and vendored paths are
  excluded explicitly, as is the behavior-source `docs/planning/` history, which the sprint runbook
  protects from mechanical rewrites. New working files cannot fall outside the gate. A one-time
  repository-wide mechanical normalization was reviewed separately from behavior changes. **This
  gate does not currently run on Windows:** it launches Prettier through the `node_modules/.bin`
  shim, and Node refuses to spawn a `.cmd` without `shell: true` (CVE-2024-27980), so the command
  exits non-zero having formatted nothing. Run directly against every in-scope tracked file,
  Prettier reports no formatting debt, so the red result is the launcher and not the source. See
  Known debt.
- `npm run test:rules` and `npm run test:storage` select temporary emulator ports and use local
  OpenJDK when it is installed outside the default PATH. The repository pins `firebase-tools` so
  the emulator wrapper does not download an unbounded CLI version at execution time.
- `npm run test:fixtures` starts temporary Auth/Firestore emulators and exercises the synthetic
  seed command; the full `npm run emulators` launcher retains conventional fixed ports for app
  development and adds the same local Java fallback.
- `npm run verify` runs the local type, lint, format, documentation, unit, Functions unit and
  emulator integration, Rules, Storage, fixture-smoke, isolated Chromium user journeys,
  build, generated-artifact freshness, and working-tree/committed-range diff checks in one command.
  Run `npm run test:functions:integration` directly to debug reward, friendly, or tournament
  callable/trigger boundaries; use `npm run test:e2e` for the browser boundary.

## Architecture freshness

`npm run docs:verify` checks the primary architecture, domain, security, engineering, and recovery
documents and fails when a mapped architecture-sensitive change set has no directly relevant
documentation review. The mapping covers Firebase configuration/rules, callable and reward
boundaries, tournament/data-access modules, and migration tooling. Expand it when a new durable
boundary is introduced. Provider-role authority is `providers/{id}.member_uid`;
`scripts/migrations/004-provider-role.mjs` is the bounded planner that lifts leftover preference
inference onto those rows.

The comparison baseline is always the `dev-anuj` branch, resolved through
`scripts/lib/comparison-base.mjs`: an explicit `ARCHITECTURE_BASE_SHA` first (CI supplies the real
push or pull-request base), then `origin/dev-anuj`, then the same branch on any other configured
remote, then the local branch. The indirection is not decoration. In a clone that also has the
production repository attached, `origin` is not necessarily the repository `dev-anuj` lives in, and
the earlier hard-coded `origin/dev-anuj` silently failed to resolve there. The gate then fell back
to treating every file as changed and printed a pass, so it reported success without performing the
check it exists to perform. Resolution now fails loudly when no candidate exists, and the pass line
names the baseline it used, so a green result can be checked rather than trusted.

### Sprint D1 review note

The D1 implementation keeps tournament score submission and result application Function-authoritative,
uses a shared overlay stack for nested Escape handling, and treats legacy P/G counters as read-only
compatibility data. New profile and tournament writes do not create those counters. Validation for this
slice is local-only; production deployment and production data mutation are explicitly out of scope,
with staging deferred until an isolated project and recovery path are approved.

### Sprint D3 review note

The D3 UI foundation centralizes the page/card/recess color tokens, field and button geometry,
keyboard focus/reduced-motion behavior, and the design assertion suite in
`scripts/verify-design-d3.mjs`. Routing preserves legacy tournament query parameters, and the
notification triggers deduplicate draw notices, digest event joins, include assigned organizers,
and omit the retired ladder-reset/bye noise. Validation is local-only; no production deployment,
data mutation, or staging promotion was performed. Staging remains deferred until an authorized
isolated project and verified recovery path exist.

## Vendor boundary

### Sprint D4 review note

The D4 slice makes event placement, withdrawal, zone state, and knockout seating explicit at the
data boundary. Participant creation is server-triggered; browser and nightly placement paths are
not used. Withdrawal is a callable workflow that preserves played matches, records unplayed
walkovers, and notifies affected members. The client no longer gates Matches on profile completion,
rewrites event skill snapshots from profile edits, or auto-seeds knockout seats. Rules now use
allowlisted participant/preference fields. Validation is local-only; production deployment and
data mutation remain out of scope, with staging deferred until an authorized project and verified
recovery path exist.

### Sprint D5 review note

The D5 slice adds typed component primitives with real call-site consumption, a real 404 route,
event-scoped organizer checks, flag-only task checklist writes, server-issued provider records,
the `services` catalog, callable-owned booking transitions, and callable claim review. Legacy task
offers and preference provider fields remain read-only compatibility fallbacks until a separately
authorized migration. Group lessons are retired from the active client/Rules surface. Validation
is local-only; no production deployment or data mutation was performed, and staging is deferred
until an authorized project and verified recovery path exist.

### Sprint D6 preparation review note

This slice is groundwork, not feature work. The emulator launcher moves around a busy port instead
of refusing to start, so a developer with something already bound to 8080 is not blocked;
`--strict-ports` keeps the old refusal for CI, where a busy port is a real signal rather than an
inconvenience. The Windows `spawn EINVAL` workaround — resolve a package's real CLI entry and launch
it with `process.execPath` instead of going through the `.bin` `.cmd` shim — was carried across the
emulator, integration, browser-test, and deploy launchers so the repository survives a clean clone
on Windows. `scripts/run-prettier.mjs` was missed by that sweep and still uses the shim; that is the
single reason the formatting gate is red.

Test data and the document shape are now declared and enforced rather than described: a shape
reference under test, a transform that produces a pseudonymised local dataset from a live snapshot,
and a seeder that refuses any project but `rands-local`. The walkover field rename is the one
behavioural-surface change, and it is a naming cleanup with no data migration behind it.

Validation is local-only; no production deployment or data mutation was performed, and staging
remains deferred until an authorized isolated project and verified recovery path exist.

`.agents/skills/gstack/` is tracked third-party agent tooling kept for reproducible local workflows.
`.gitattributes` marks it as vendored for repository language metrics; ESLint and application tests
also exclude it. Security review must still inspect the vendor tree when its source or lock changes.
The pinned source and update procedure remain in `docs/engineering/AGENT_SKILLS.md` and
`skills-lock.json`.

## Known debt

- Some route hooks still mix Firestore subscriptions and presentation state. TASK-665 extracted
  the tournament organizer queues, event registration counts, and Marketplace catalog grouping;
  extract further only when a repository boundary centralizes paths, normalization, or transaction
  behavior.
- Tournament result application, ladder challenge points, and Round Robin group bonuses are
  Function-authoritative. Production deployment and migration remain out of scope; staging waits
  for an authorized project and verified recovery path.
- Functions remain JavaScript. Shared callable validation is centralized first; TypeScript
  migration should follow where integration coverage is strong.
- Signup intentionally has a pre-auth email-existence check so secondary-email migration remains
  usable. The callable requires App Check outside the Functions emulator; staging provider setup and
  abuse-rate verification remain external environment gates.
- The focused Hosting-emulator suite covers login/profile, signup bootstrap, event join, and one
  tournament scoring/advancement journey. Reward and friendly edge cases remain at the more
  deterministic callable/trigger emulator boundary.
- `npm run format:check` cannot launch Prettier on Windows: `scripts/run-prettier.mjs` spawns the
  `node_modules/.bin/prettier.cmd` shim directly, which Node refuses without `shell: true`. The fix
  is the pattern already used by the emulator, integration, browser-test, and deploy launchers —
  resolve the package's real CLI entry and run it with `process.execPath`. Until then the gate is
  red on Windows and green on Linux CI, which is the worst of both: contributors see a failure they
  cannot act on, and no one learns anything from the pass.
- `npm audit` remains non-zero through transitive development tooling. Dependency upgrades need a
  separate compatibility review; this block does not use an automatic mass-fix.
