# Project-local Agent Skills

This inventory records the skills discoverable from this repository. The lock file is the machine-readable installation record; this document explains routing and provenance without copying third-party skill contents.

Last verified against the current `spiderman` application checkout plus the pinned project-local
skill installation.

## Firebase Agent Skills

Source: `firebase/agent-skills` on GitHub. These are existing project-local skills preserved from the repository and tracked in `skills-lock.json` with computed hashes.

## Architecture diagrams

- Canonical format: Mermaid fenced blocks in `docs/architecture/diagrams/*.md`.
- Ten files: six current-system / delivery diagrams plus location-scoping, partner-pool, play-loops, and client-layer-map.
- Rendered HTML/SVG exports and the project-local diagram-generation skill are intentionally not part of the project workflow.

## gstack

- Source: `garrytan/gstack` on GitHub.
- Local path: `.agents/skills/gstack/`.
- Upstream HEAD observed at installation: `60e51342b54553cf4347ce7a786cae508125053e`.
- Local suite version: `1.67.2.0`.
- Installer lock hash for the root router: `845bbc368b6878914a53e28b60ff9be7aa2eabd689f6514842b159b46544982a`.
- The project-local copy includes the upstream router and subskills. Available workflows include `autoplan`, `plan-ceo-review`, `plan-eng-review`, `plan-devex-review`, `review`, `investigate`, `cso`, `qa`, `qa-only`, `document-generate`, `document-release`, `retro`, `careful`, `guard`, and `freeze`, plus the upstream suite’s other specialized skills. Inspect the matching nested `SKILL.md` before use.
- Do not invoke gstack workflows that merge to `main`, deploy production, or rewrite history. In this project, “ship” means a reviewed commit pushed to `origin/dev-anuj` only.

The gstack tree is third-party vendored tooling, not application source. Keep its upstream revision
and `skills-lock.json` hash synchronized when updating it; do not silently edit the vendored copy
to fix application findings.

## Project-specific skill

- `.claude/skills/deploy-rules/SKILL.md` is repository-local operational guidance for Firebase rules deployment. It is not represented in `skills-lock.json`; review it before any rules deployment and keep deployment explicitly environment-gated.

## Update procedure

1. Inspect the upstream source and current lock file.
2. Install into `.agents/skills/` without `-g`.
3. Review the exact file diff and source revision/hash.
4. Update this inventory and `skills-lock.json` together.
5. Run the relevant validation, commit the change separately, and push only to `dev-anuj`.
