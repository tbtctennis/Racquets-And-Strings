          Outside, the animated <main> is itself inside the boundary: a route chunk that suspends
          makes React hide the whole subtree, so <main> is stuck holding its `initial` opacity of 0
          and the enter animation never runs — and `mode="wait"` is simultaneously waiting on an
          exit that can no longer complete. The page then renders header, footer and background
          with an invisible <main> between them. It shows up on a COLD load of a deep route (a link
          opened from an email), because in-app navigation usually has the chunk cached and never
          suspends at all.
          In here, <main> itself never suspends: it animates in normally and the spinner below
          renders inside it. */}
