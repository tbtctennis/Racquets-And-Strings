/**
 * Recovery for stale lazy chunks after a deploy.
 *
 * A tab left open across a deploy still holds the OLD build's hashed chunk URLs. Navigating to a
 * route it hasn't loaded yet requests a file Hosting no longer has (previous deploys' assets
 * aren't retained), and the dynamic import rejects. Nothing about this is fixable with cache
 * headers — index.html is already `no-cache`; the problem is that a long-open tab never re-fetches
 * index.html at all, so it keeps a hash map that no longer matches the server.
 *
 * The only real cure is one reload, which pulls the current index.html and its current hashes.
 *
 * THE HARD RULE HERE: the returned promise must ALWAYS settle.
 *
 * The first version returned `new Promise(() => {})` after kicking off a reload, on the assumption
 * that the reload would tear the page down before React rendered again. It doesn't —
 * `location.reload()` is asynchronous, React keeps rendering, and a lazy payload that never
 * settles leaves Suspense pending forever with no timeout and no error path out. That is what
 * made /marketplace open blank until the user reloaded by hand. Throwing isn't an escape either:
 * React caches a rejected lazy payload permanently, so the error just moves to the root boundary
 * and takes the whole app down. So both failure paths now resolve to a real component.
