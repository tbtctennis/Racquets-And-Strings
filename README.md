# Racquets & Strings

Racquets & Strings is a React/Vite tennis-league platform backed by Firebase. The current application includes member profiles, events and tournaments, matches and rankings, tasks and rewards, marketplace listings, court data, notifications, and provider-related service flows.

This repository is technical project documentation and application source. The working branch for the current engineering block is `spiderman`.

## Verified stack

- React 19 + TypeScript 5.8
- Vite 6 + Tailwind CSS 4
- Firebase Web SDK 12
- Firebase Auth, Firestore, Storage, Hosting, and Cloud Functions
- Cloud Functions on Node.js 22, region `us-central1`
- Resend is used by server-side notification code

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22 and npm
- A Java runtime on `PATH` for the Firestore Emulator Suite
- Git access to `tbtctennis/Racquets-And-Strings`

The Functions package declares Node.js 22. Use that runtime for both root and Functions dependency installation to avoid version drift.

## First-time setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tbtctennis/Racquets-And-Strings.git ~/Developer/RandS-Tennis
cd ~/Developer/RandS-Tennis
git checkout spiderman
npm ci
cd functions && npm ci
cd ..
npx playwright install chromium
cp .env.example .env.local
```

On Linux CI or a fresh Linux workstation, use `npx playwright install --with-deps chromium` when
system browser libraries are not already installed.

The template defaults to local emulators with a synthetic `rands-local` project ID. Vite exposes only variables prefixed with `VITE_`; do not place service-account credentials, Resend secrets, or other private keys in this file. The Functions `RESEND_API_KEY` is a server-managed Firebase secret, not a client environment variable.

## Local development

The full fresh-checkout walkthrough, local credentials, alternate-port workflow, test matrix, and
environment claim boundaries live in [Local development and verification](docs/engineering/LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md).

Start the Emulator Suite in one terminal and the Vite app in another:

```bash
npm run emulators
# in a second terminal, after the emulator suite is ready:
npm run seed:emulator
npm run dev
```

The Vite server uses port `3000`; the full Emulator Suite uses the ports declared in `firebase.json`.
The launcher adds the repository's Java 21 Homebrew path when it is available. If a standard
emulator port is occupied, the local-development guide documents the supported `firebase.local.json`
and matching `VITE_*_EMULATOR_PORT` overrides for a complete alternate-port app workflow. The
temporary-port test commands below remain the quickest option when only verification is needed.
The emulator scripts explicitly select the synthetic `rands-local` project and do not use the
production alias in `.firebaserc`.
Firestore and Storage Rules test commands use temporary emulator configurations and select an
available local port, which avoids collisions with unrelated services. Java is still required by
the Firestore Emulator Suite. The repository pins `firebase-tools` and invokes the local binary;
it does not download an unbounded CLI version during tests.

`npm run seed:emulator` writes only deterministic synthetic Auth users and Firestore data to the local emulators (`rands-local`) and refuses any other project ID or non-local Auth host. The fixture set covers member, organizer, provider, multi-role, event, Round Robin draft, match, task/reward, marketplace, notification, court, and aggregate paths. The seeded sign-in accounts use the `.invalid` emails and passwords listed in `tests/fixtures/local-fixtures.mjs`; they are local-only credentials.
`npm run test:fixtures` starts an isolated temporary Auth/Firestore emulator pair and exercises the
same seed command without using the fixed ports needed by the full local app suite.

GitHub CI runs on pushes and pull requests targeting `spiderman`, installs Node 22 and Java 21, and
runs the same `npm run verify` quality gates plus a separate Functions dependency install. It does
not deploy or connect to Firebase.

## Validation commands

```bash
npm run typecheck     # Full TypeScript strict check, no emit
npm run lint          # ESLint source, scripts, tests, and Functions checks
npm run format:check  # Every tracked first-party file; generated and vendored paths excluded
npm test              # Pure domain and data-contract tests
npm run test:rules    # Firestore Rules suite in a temporary local emulator
npm run test:storage  # Storage Rules suite in a temporary local emulator
npm run test:fixtures # Synthetic Auth/Firestore seed smoke test in temporary emulators
npm run test:functions:integration # Reward, friendly, and tournament callable/trigger emulator paths
npm run test:e2e                  # Synthetic signup, login, event join, and tournament score journeys
npm run build         # Generates the programs CSV, then creates dist/
npm run verify        # All local quality gates in one command
npm run preview       # Serves the built dist/ locally
npm run seed:emulator # Seeds synthetic local Firestore data; emulator must be running
cd functions && npm test # Pure Functions helper tests
```

Project architecture and security validation gaps are tracked in [docs/engineering/SECURITY_BASELINE.md](docs/engineering/SECURITY_BASELINE.md). Email delivery safety and DNS verification steps are tracked in [docs/runbooks/RESEND_DOMAIN_VERIFICATION.md](docs/runbooks/RESEND_DOMAIN_VERIFICATION.md).

## Firebase and deployment safety

`.firebaserc` has no default project; it contains only the explicit `local -> rands-local` alias.
The production-sensitive project is intentionally not an active CLI default. `hosting:deploy` and
`hosting:preview` require `FIREBASE_DEPLOY_PROJECT_ID`; production also requires two explicit
approval environment variables. Do not run a production action from this checkout without an
approved environment plan. Use the explicit-project, approval-gated workflow for any deployment.

For an isolated staging project, use the project ID supplied by the environment owner:

```bash
FIREBASE_DEPLOY_PROJECT_ID=<staging-project-id> npm run hosting:preview
```

The guard script is `scripts/deploy-hosting.mjs`. It never infers the deployment project from `.firebaserc`. It covers Hosting only; Rules, Storage, and Functions promotion remain separate approval-gated operational work because this checkout has no authorized staging project.

The remaining environment work is to establish:

1. local Firebase emulators; **implemented for local and isolated test use**;
2. an isolated staging project and explicit project selection;
3. broader callable/trigger integration coverage beyond the implemented reward, friendly, and tournament gates;
4. approval-gated production deployment documentation.

## Common troubleshooting

- **Firebase configuration is incomplete:** confirm all required `VITE_FIREBASE_*` values exist in `.env.local`, then restart Vite.
- **Functions dependency/runtime warnings:** use Node.js 22 and reinstall from `functions/package-lock.json` with `npm ci`.
- **Build output changes:** `npm run build` regenerates `public/programs-tennis.csv` before Vite builds `dist/`; review generated changes before committing.
- **Rules or production behavior questions:** inspect the current rules and architecture documents; do not validate against the production project by default.
